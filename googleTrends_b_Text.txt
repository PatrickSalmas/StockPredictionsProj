[<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 Armchair NFL fans with Verizon FiOS who are hoping to watch Sunday\u2019s Chargers-Ravens wild card game on WUSA/Channel 9 should consider making alternative viewing plans.</p>, <p>Thanks to an ongoing contract dispute, Channel 9 is<a href="https://wtop.com/tv/2019/01/wusa-9-cbs-shows-go-dark-for-verizon-fios-subscribers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> still blacked out on FiOS.</a></p>, <p>The money-related programming conflict is between Tegna, which is Channel 9\u2019s parent company, and Verizon, and there\u2019s no sign when it will end. In fact, the dispute appears to be getting worse.</p>, <p>Verizon announced Wednesday afternoon that Tegna was no longer negotiating with them, <a href="https://wtop.com/news/2019/01/wusa-goes-dark-for-verizon-fios-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Washington Business Journal reported.</a></p>, <p>One option for Ravens fans with FiOS is to livestream the game through a provider such as fuboTV, Hulu Plus, or YouTube TV.</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of them out there, and most of them give you a seven day trial period,\u201d said Ken Colburn of Data Doctors.</p>, <p>For example,\xa0CBS All Access offers a one-week free trial and Hulu offers streaming from top sports networks like CBS and live NFL and NCAA football <a href="https://www.hulu.com/live-sports?&amp;cmp=8659&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BM%20Search%20Sitelink%20Live&amp;utm_term=+live%20+sports%20+hulu&amp;ds_rl=1244764&amp;ds_rl=1244764&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAgrfhBRA3EiwAnfF4tm_I3jwSUe45o5e4Bb_s9NXSyR8wFkg0V3yT90Hbch1jgOMbXB1wqxoCzcwQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">through a free trial\xa0</a>for new subscribers and eligible existing subscribers.</p>, <p>Another idea? Buy an HDTV antenna to pick up Channel 9\u2019s free over-the-air signal.</p>, <p>\u201cFortunately they\u2019re really inexpensive. They\u2019re $20 to $30. There\u2019s lots of them on Amazon. In fact, Amazon itself has an Amazon Basics line of indoor antennas that work really well,\u201d said Colburn. \u201cThe single most important thing to ensure that you get the best possible signal is make sure you get an HDTV antenna that comes with its own amplifier.\u201d</p>, <p>If you live in an urban area you shouldn\u2019t have any problem picking up major local channels, but Colburn said you can plug your address into\xa0<a href="http://tvfool.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TV Fool</a> to find out which direction the broadcast signals are coming from so you can best position your antenna.</p>, <p>The FCC has <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/dtvantennas.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a helpful guide</a> to antennas and digital TV. Colburn also shared <a href="https://www.datadoctors.com/help/kenscolumns/22229-Wading-Through-Streaming-TV-Options/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a very useful tool</a> for comparing various streaming services.</p>, <p><em>EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Amazon Prime members can get a 30-day free trail of CBS All Access.\xa0</em></p>, <p><em>Like WTOP on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wtopnews">Facebook</a> and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/WTOP">@WTOP</a> on Twitter to engage in conversation about this article and others.</em></p>, <p>\xa9 2019 WTOP.

It reportedly weighs in at about 3.5 lbs and has an additional backstrap and shoulder padding for added comfort:</p>, <p class="a1dbe d0e40">The backpack, which retails for nearly 26,000 yen ($240) on the Japanese retailer Plywood, is <a href="http://www.plywood.jp/shop/shopdetail.html?brandcode=000000006176&amp;search=backpack&amp;sort=">sold out</a> in all three of its sensible colors (beige, olive, and black) and is set to be restocked.

[<p>Chipotle, eager to promote itself as a healthy choice, tweaked its menu to fit with trendy diet plans.</p>, <p>Beginning Wednesday, the Mexican food chain will begin offering \u201cLifestyle Bowls,\u201d a new collection of meals that fit into paleo, ketogenic and Whole30 diets.</p>, <p>\u201cThese first-to-category, diet-driven menu offerings are helping those who have committed to living a healthier lifestyle by making it easy to order delicious bowls that only contain the real ingredients permitted by certain diet regimens,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p>, <p>The new bowls can be ordered on Chipotle\u2019s (<a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMG">CMG</a>) app or online. The items consist of ingredients already on the menu, so walk-in eaters can also order the bowls.</p>, <p>The diet bowls include:</p>, <p>All three of these diets follow strict rules and <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/17/news/companies/keto-diet-trend/index.html">are growing in popularity.</a></p>, <p>The ketogenic diet includes low-carb, high-fat foods that force the body into a state of ketosis \xe2\u20ac\u201d when you burn fat, instead of carbohydrates, for energy. Whole30 cuts out sugar, grains, dairy and legumes for 30 days, and paleo is modeled after eating habits in the paleolithic era.</p>, <p>The move toward diet food is another step in Chipotle\u2019s reinvention, as it works to recover from a series of health scares at its restaurants.</p>, <p>The new bowls are latest change under CEO Brian Niccol, the former head of Taco Bell, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/21/investing/chipotle-brian-niccol/index.html">has turned the restaurant around</a> after a number of people got sick during multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness in recent years.

Apple's stock then <a href="/2019/01/03/apple-stock-falls-after-cutting-q1-guidance-on-weak-iphone-sales.html">cratered as much as 10 percent Thursday</a>, closing with its biggest single-day loss in six years, as investors started to question the broader implications of this announcement.</p>, <p>Electronics retailer Best Buy, being a key vendor partner to Apple, could now face some challenges, UBS analyst Michael Lasser said Thursday in a note to clients.</p>, <p>UBS has estimated that roughly 15 to 20 percent of Best Buy's total sales are of Apple products, which tend to sell at higher price points than other merchandise in Best Buy stores.</p>, <p>And "Apple's significance to Best Buy goes beyond just its direct sales contribution," Lasser said. Apple products "drive traffic and motivate consumers" to go into Best Buy stores in the first place, he said.</p>, <p>As recently as last month, Best Buy has argued its relationship with Apple is still going strong.</p>, <p>"We've built over the years a very unique experience selling Apple products," Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly told analysts on an earnings conference call. "Apple would say ... Best Buy provides the best retail experience for their products and services outside of their own home."</p>, <p>Best Buy has about 900 Apple stores within its stores in addition to roughly 3,000 employees who focus solely on selling Apple devices.</p>, <p>Joly added that "it's unclear at this point what the net effect is going to be" for Best Buy now that <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="9399" data-inline-quote-symbol="AMZN" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN">Amazon</a> is starting to sell Apple devices on its website. But this remains a top concern for the retailer on Wall Street, moving forward.</p>, <p>As Apple looks to sell its iPhones and other devices through <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="13906" data-inline-quote-symbol="COST" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=COST">Costco</a>, Amazon and other distributors to boost sales growth, it will make it harder for Best Buy to maintain its own sales gains, Lasser said. He compared the situation to when <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="46115" data-inline-quote-symbol="UAA" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAA">Under Armour</a> started selling at <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="23110" data-inline-quote-symbol="KSS" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=KSS">Kohl's</a>, hurting sales of the athletic apparel brand at <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="15235" data-inline-quote-symbol="DKS" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DKS">Dick's Sporting Goods</a>. "Apple's moves might not be as draconian for Best Buy," he said. "But, they do illustrate a risk."</p>, <p>A Best Buy spokesman didn't immediately return CNBC's request for comment.</p>, <p>Best Buy shares closed down more than 2 percent Thursday.

A round-trip flight in business class from Vietnam to New York cost as little as $674.63, a small fraction of the usual price, according to One Mile at a Time, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://onemileatatime.com/cathay-pacific-cheap-business-class-fare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a travel blog</a> that documented the fares.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">\u201cCathay Pacific does actually do some quite aggressive fare sales from Asia,\u201d said Rob Burgess, the editor of a frequent flier website, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.headforpoints.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">headforpoints.com</a>. Business class seats from Asia to the United States can be found for around $5,000.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">But not this aggressive.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">The low prices, offered by mistake for several hours on Monday in North America, caught Cathay Pacific itself by surprise.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">On Wednesday, the airline acknowledged the error but said it would honor the fares. On Thursday, the trip that had briefly cost less than $700 appeared on the Cathay Pacific website for about $16,000 for a fully flexible fare.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Mr. Burgess said that ticketing errors happen often when airlines deal with bookings to hundreds of destinations and in dozens of currencies. These processes work automatically but, \u201csomewhere in the system there\u2019s a human typing a number in,\u201d he said, which can lead to mistakes like mixing up currencies or leaving a zero off a price.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Cathay Pacific did not say how many people had been quick enough to take advantage of the accidental bargain.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">\u201cYes \u2014 we made a mistake but we look forward to welcoming you on board with your ticket issued,\u201d the airline wrote on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/cathaypacific/status/1080373505806426114" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Twitter</a>, with the hashtags \u201c#promisemadepromisekept,\u201d and \u201c#lessonlearnt.\u201d</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Airlines tend to catch such glitches in a matter of hours, leaving the opportunity open to only the most up-to-date shoppers. Carriers that do not honor such tickets refund the purchase prices, so there is little downside to snapping them up.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">\u201cThese tickets are always booked by the same people,\u201d Mr. Burgess said \u2014 travel enthusiasts who, he said, often monitor travel websites obsessively. \u201dThere\u2019s no risk at all as long as you are smart enough not to book a hotel\u201d or other nonrefundable travel associated with the tickets.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">A competing carrier, Hong Kong Airlines, made a similar mistake last August, selling $600 business-class seats on flights from Asia to North America. The airline honored the fares, possibly setting an example for Cathay Pacific to follow, travel writers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/grantmartin/2019/01/02/cathay-pacific-accidentally-sells-international-business-class-fares-for-the-price-of-economy/#14ce41b1139d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">commented</a>.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">For Cathay Pacific, this wasn\u2019t the first glitch in the past year. In October, the airline said a data breach had exposed the personal details and travel histories of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/business/cathay-pacific-hack.html?module=inline" title="">as many as 9.4 million people</a>.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">While the airline has so far kept the cause and cost of the glitch quiet, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2180367/cathay-pacific-customer-who-bought-first-class" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the mistake may result in a six-figure loss</a> or more, The South China Morning Post reported. Along with the tickets themselves, the rare bargain included the accompanying mileage credit, giving buyers discounted credit toward frequent flier status, with lounge access and other benefits.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Cathay Pacific, known for its long-haul routes from its hub in Hong Kong, is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://skytraxratings.com/airlines/cathay-pacific-airways-rating" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">regularly rated</a> among the world\u2019s best airlines. Its flatbed business and first-class seats with big-screen entertainment and fine dining have received praise from frequent travelers. But the carrier has been facing growing competition in Asia and recorded losses in 2016, 2017 and the first half of 2018.</p>, <p><i>Follow Palko Karasz on Twitter: </i><a href="https://twitter.com/karaszpalko"><i>@karaszpalko</i></a><i>.</i></p>, <p class="css-19n3nxx etcg8100"></p>, <p class="css-19n3nxx etcg8100"></p>, <p class="css-19n3nxx etcg8100"></p>, <p>Advertisement</p>]

[<p>\n\t\xa0Facebook\u2019s essential facility is unclear \u2013 is it a social network; a publisher of video, text, pictures and games; a communications service; or an advertising agency?</p>, <p>\n\tIn July last year, a week after she fined Google \u20ac4.34bn (\xa33.9bn) for\xa0 breaching antitrust rules, the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, appeared on <em>Anger Management</em>, a podcast run by the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. It was not the first time they had spoken \u2013 the European Commission\u2019s list of meetings shows they met officially in January 2017 \u2013 but Clegg\u2019s public chat with the regulator most feared by Big Tech may have landed him a job. Less than three months later, Facebook announced that Clegg had been appointed as its new head of global affairs and communications.\n<p>\n\tThe following month, amid many fewer column inches, Facebook made two more significant hires: Johan Keetelaar, director of telecommunications at the Authority for Consumers and Markets in the Netherlands, and Kate Patchen, who led the US department of justice\u2019s antitrust section in San Francisco \u2013 in other words, two of the most senior competition regulators in Europe and the US. Facebook has hired top lawmakers in the past, including Timothy Muris, former chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission, and Kevin Martin, former chair of the Federal Communications Commission. But this activity has increased as the tech giant is accused of obliterating the press, spreading hatred and misinformation, and operating a monopoly.\n<p>\n\tIt is this last point that is most important to lawmakers. Claims that Facebook has swayed elections or even played a role in genocide are appalling, but difficult to prove. A monopoly is quantifiable. Facebook has a market share of 77 per cent of social media use in Europe, not including Instagram, which it owns. The original uses of the mobile phone, speech and messaging, have largely been captured by WhatsApp, which serves 65 billion messages and 3,800 years\u2019 worth of calls a day, and is owned, again, by Facebook.\xa0<div class="dianomi-ad dianomi-ad-2"><iframe height="150" scrolling="NO" src="//www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4302" style="width: 100%; border: none; overflow: hidden;" width="500"></iframe></div>\n<p>\n\tWhen Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham asked him to name his main competitor, or a product that consumers could choose instead. As Zuckerberg stalled, Graham asked if Facebook was a monopoly. The best Zuckerberg could offer was that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like that to me\u201d.\n<p>\n\tThe documents seized in late November by Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, detail a pattern of activity at Facebook that certainly feels anti-competitive. Competitors that used Facebook\u2019s Onavo app \u2013 sold as a security measure \u2013 were monitored. Commercial partners were \u201cwhitelisted\u201d for special access to user data. On 24 January 2013, Twitter \u2013 Facebook \u2018s biggest competitor for social media market share \u2013 launched an app called Vine, which enabled users to post short, shareable videos. The same day, Facebook\u2019s vice president Justin Osofsky emailed Mark Zuckerberg to warn him that Vine users could \u201cfind friends via FB [Facebook]\u201d and to suggest they \u201cshut down their friends API access today\u201d \u2013 throttling the data that Vine could receive from its own users. Zuckerberg replied: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201d\n<p>\n\tFacebook is also a new kind of company \u2013 global, nebulous and constantly changing. The economist Jean Tirole points out that natural monopolies occur when a technology\u2019s \u201cessential facility\u201d cannot realistically be duplicated. Railway lines, an energy grid or a telephone network all do one job for which it is very hard to create a competing alternative. Last century, it was possible to break up Standard Oil and AT&amp;T into smaller entities without affecting the services they provided. Yet Facebook\u2019s essential facility is less clear \u2013 is it a social network; a publisher of video, text, pictures and games; a communications service; or an advertising agency? Nor can it be separated into equally valuable components; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and others are interdependent, and the data they share is crucial to Facebook\u2019s dominance.<div class="dianomi-ad dianomi-ad-1"><iframe height="150" scrolling="NO" src="//www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=3585" style="width: 100%; border: none; overflow: hidden;" width="500"></iframe></div>\n<p>\n\tThere is also the question of who gets to regulate Facebook, and how. The EU can issue heavy fines, but a company that serves 2.2 billion people around the world is a slippery thing to regulate. This is why Facebook, despite having made \xa31.3bn from advertising sales in the UK last year, paid just \xa37.4m net tax (0.62 per cent).\n<p>\n\tThe political will to tame Facebook may also waver. Donald Trump has said that his administration is \u201ccertainly looking\u201d at antitrust allegations, but his new North American Free Trade Agreement gives Facebook more power to challenge US regulators. It must also be asked why he would regulate a company credited with assisting his rise to power.\n<p>\n\tYet this does not mean that 2019 will be a great year for Facebook, because there are still two agents who can do more than any regulator to curtail Facebook\u2019s power. These are the agents who gave it that power in the first place: the user and the investor.<div class="dianomi-ad dianomi-ad-3"><iframe height="150" scrolling="NO" src="//www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4303" style="width: 100%; border: none; overflow: hidden;" width="500"></iframe></div>\n<p>\n\tOn 25 July last year, Facebook\u2019s total stock market capitalisation was over $620bn (\xa3490bn). This is as much as $500bn (\xa3395bn) more than all the revenue it has earned since it became cash-flow positive in 2009. On 26 July, Facebook published quarterly results that showed slower-than-expected growth of both revenue and users. The company\u2019s stock fell 20 per cent, wiping $120bn (\xa390.8bn) off its market cap; it has since fallen to its lowest level for more than 18 months. In less than an hour, Zuckerberg lost an amount of money comparable to the yearly GDP of Cambodia.\n<p>\n\tIn September, Pew Research published a survey of 3,400 Facebook users which found that 44 per cent of the 18-29 age group had deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the past year. This, more than anything else, should be Facebook\u2019s wake-up call; nearly every trend in internet use has been led by the young. These users are the product Facebook sells to its clients, and they appear to be leaving in droves.\n<p>\n\tThis could be because of Facebook\u2019s many scandals. But\xa0 monopolies are also dull. And on the internet, sold to the young as a cure for boredom, no regulator is as powerful as the simple decision to switch off.<div class="video-inread unruly-video">\n<div id="1x3">\n<script type="text/javascript">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("1x3"); });\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </script>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>\n<strong>Read all the pieces in our \u201c2019 \u2013 the big questions\u201d\xa0series:\xa0</strong>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-trump-go-war"><strong>John Bew: Will Trump go to war?</strong></a>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-there-be-another-crash"><strong>Felix Martin: Will there be another crash?</strong></a><div class="dianomi-ad dianomi-ad-3"><iframe height="150" scrolling="NO" src="//www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4303" style="width: 100%; border: none; overflow: hidden;" width="500"></iframe></div>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-brexit-actually-happen"><strong>George Eaton: Will Brexit actually happen?</strong></a>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2019/01/2019-big-questions-are-tv-channels-irrelevant"><strong>Anna Leszkiewicz: Are TV channels irrelevant?</strong></a>\n<p>\n<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-far-right-triumph-europe"><b>Paul Mason: Will the far right triumph in Europe?</b></a>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>, <p>\n\tThe following month, amid many fewer column inches, Facebook made two more significant hires: Johan Keetelaar, director of telecommunications at the Authority for Consumers and Markets in the Netherlands, and Kate Patchen, who led the US department of justice\u2019s antitrust section in San Francisco \u2013 in other words, two of the most senior competition regulators in Europe and the US.

The EU can issue heavy fines, but a company that serves 2.2 billion people around the world is a slippery thing to regulate. This is why Facebook, despite having made \xa31.3bn from advertising sales in the UK last year, paid just \xa37.4m net tax (0.62 per cent).\n<p>\n\tThe political will to tame Facebook may also waver. Donald Trump has said that his administration is \u201ccertainly looking\u201d at antitrust allegations, but his new North American Free Trade Agreement gives Facebook more power to challenge US regulators.

On 26 July, Facebook published quarterly results that showed slower-than-expected growth of both revenue and users. The company\u2019s stock fell 20 per cent, wiping $120bn (\xa390.8bn) off its market cap; it has since fallen to its lowest level for more than 18 months.

[<p class="BylineBar_reading-time" style="color:undefined">4 Min Read</p>, <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street plunged on Thursday after slowing U.S. factory activity on the heels of a dire revenue warning from Apple Inc (<span id="\u201dsymbol_AAPL.O_0\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AAPL.O">AAPL.O</a></span>) fueled fears of a global economic slowdown. </p>, <p>The magnitude of Apple\u2019s holiday quarter revenue shortfall sent shockwaves through the technology sector, which pulled all three major U.S. stock indexes down more than 2 percent, with the Nasdaq posting a 3 percent loss. </p>, <p>S&amp;P Technology companies .SPLRCT slid 5.1 percent, its biggest one-day percentage drop since August 2011. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX ended the session 5.9 percent lower. </p>, <p>Late Wednesday, Apple chief executive Tim Cook wrote in a letter to investors that the company had not foreseen the extent of China\u2019s economic deceleration, which was exacerbated by U.S.-China trade tensions. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares dropped 10.0 percent. </p>, <p>A report from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. factory activity USPMI=ECI in December suffered the biggest drop since October 2008, the height of the financial crisis. Its PMI reading, while still in expansion territory, hit its lowest level in more than two years.  </p>, <p>\u201cThe Chinese slowdown was expected but today\u2019s softer-than-expected ISM number took investors by surprise because the U.S. seemed to be the only port in the storm,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. \u201cBut now it appears that our economic growth is facing trade related headwinds.\u201d  </p>, <p>\u201cInvestors are worried that this is an indication that things could be getting worse from here and Apple is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Stovall added. </p>, <p>Major automakers reported weak U.S. new car sales in December, with Ford Motor Co (<span id="\u201dsymbol_F.N_3\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=F.N">F.N</a></span>) and General Motors Co (<span id="\u201dsymbol_GM.N_4\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GM.N">GM.N</a></span>) reporting sales falling by 8.8 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. Ford shares fell 1.5 percent, while GM dropped 4.1 percent. </p>, <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> fell 660.02 points, or 2.83 percent, to 22,686.22, the S&amp;P 500 <a href="/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> lost 62.14 points, or 2.48 percent, to 2,447.89 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> dropped 202.43 points, or 3.04 percent, to 6,463.50. </p>, <p>Of the 11 major sectors in the S&amp;P 500, all but defensive real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU stocks closed in the red. </p>, <p>Trade-sensitive industrials also weighed on the Dow, led by Caterpillar Inc (<span id="\u201dsymbol_CAT.N_10\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CAT.N">CAT.N</a></span>), 3M Co (<span id="\u201dsymbol_MMM.N_11\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=MMM.N">MMM.N</a></span>) and Boeing Co (<span id="\u201dsymbol_BA.N_12\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BA.N">BA.N</a></span>). </p>, <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (<span id="\u201dsymbol_BMY.N_13\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BMY.N">BMY.N</a></span>) shares dropped 13.3 percent after the drugmaker announced plans to buy rival Celgene Corp (<span id="\u201dsymbol_CELG.O_14\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CELG.O">CELG.O</a></span>) for about $74 billion. Celgene shares jumped 20.7 percent on the news.  </p>, <p>Shares of U.S. commercial air carriers slid after Delta Air Lines (<span id="\u201dsymbol_DAL.N_15\u201d"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=DAL.N">DAL.N</a></span>) cut its fourth quarter revenue estimate. The S&amp;P 1500 Airlines index .SPCOMAIR sank 5.9 percent. </p>, <p>Yields on 2-year Treasuries dipped below the federal funds effective rate for the first time since 2008, a move many believe suggests the central bank will not be able to continue its monetary tightening policy. The outlook for higher rates has been considered a headwind to equities in recent months. </p>, <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored decliners. </p>, <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 6 new highs and 48 new lows.   </p>, <p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.11 billion shares, compared to the 9.16 billion average over the last 20 trading days.    </p>, <p class="Attribution_content">Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Phil Berlowitz</p>, <p><span>All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

[<p>The mall used to be one of the few places teens were free to hang out far from prying parental eyes. That\u2019s no longer the case at Water Tower Place on the Magnificent Mile, the latest mall to ban unsupervised teens on Friday and Saturday evenings in an attempt to crack down on disruptive incidents.</p>, <p>From 4 p.m. until the mall closes at 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, trained public safety officers will card visitors at the Magnificent Mile shopping center\u2019s entrances, mall owner Brookfield Properties said Thursday.</p>, <p>Anyone without a valid photo ID confirming they are at least 18 years old won\u2019t be allowed into the mall unless they are accompanied by a parent or other adult who is at least 21 years old,  Brookfield said in a news release.</p>, <p>The policy \u201cis intended to help provide a safe, peaceful experience at our shopping center,\u201d Mitch Feldman, senior general manager of Water Tower Place, said in the news release.</p>, <p>The announcement comes less than a week after a Saturday evening incident involving about 60 young people that gathered on North Michigan Avenue and forced the mall to close an hour early, said Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd.</p>, <p>A handful of the teens were believed to have been involved in an attack on people in the nearby Chicago Avenue Red Line station shortly before 7:15 p.m. Saturday,  Hopkins said. Victims suffered bone fractures, cuts and bruises, police said in a news release.</p>, <p>Felony charges have been filed against one of several teens who went on a rampage at a Near North Side <a href="/topic/transportation/public-transportation/chicago-transit-authority-ORGOV000082-topic.html">CTA</a> stop last weekend, kicking and punching people, according to Chicago police.</p>, <p>The 15-year-old boy is charged with aggravated battery and mob action, the department said in a release.</p>, <p>Police...</p>, <p>\u201cThis stood out as an aberration because the injuries were severe,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cBut this type of incident, involving large numbers of juveniles engaged in hostile attacks that appear to be random, happens with disturbing frequency.\u201d</p>, <p>Most of the incidents he hears about are more minor and aren\u2019t always reported,  he said.</p>, <p>Brookfield said in an email that disruptive behavior from unsupervised teens  has been an issue at Water Tower Place in recent months and it decided to move ahead with a formal curfew after the  Saturday incident. The program  also will help eliminate distractions for security officers at the mall, Brookfield said.</p>, <p>Water Tower Place is far from the first mall to require adult supervision. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., which, like Water Tower Place, is a major tourist destination, has had a similar policy since 1996.</p>, <p>At the Mall of America, children under age 16 must be accompanied by an adult who is at least 21 after 4 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and the policy was enforced all day between Dec. 26 and 31.</p>, <p>Brookfield has similar policies at a handful of other properties, but Water Tower Place is its first in Illinois to adopt one.</p>, <p>Starting Friday afternoon, public safety officers in the mall will check the identification of anyone who appears to be under 18 years old. Valid IDs must be tamper-proof and include a photo and date of birth. Acceptable forms of identification may include state-issued driver\u2019s licenses or ID cards, military IDs, school IDs or passports. Shoppers will be offered a wristband if they\u2019ve passed an ID check.</p>, <p>Each adult can accompany up to four minors between ages 10 and 17. There is no limit on the number of kids under 10 one adult can supervise.</p>, <p>For about six years, west suburban North Riverside Park Mall has restricted unsupervised teens\u2019 access to the mall after 6 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Last weekend, the mall was forced to close several hours early on Saturday when large groups of young people caused disturbances that resulted in two arrests, said Harvey Ahitow, the mall\u2019s general manager.</p>, <p>On Wednesday, the mall again stepped up security measures and began barring unsupervised minors at 11 a.m. in response to social media threats suggesting more incidents. There were no incidents, he said.</p>, <p>Incidents are more common on holiday weekends, and social media has made it easier for large groups to organize, he said.</p>, <p>\u201cIn my mind, we would absolutely have more trouble if we weren\u2019t controlling the kids coming into the center,\u201d  Ahitow said.</p>, <p>The mall initially received some pushback from its movie theater and granted it an exemption. Some food court tenants also worried about losing business. But overall, Ahitow said he\u2019s received few complaints.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen you create a more peaceful environment, it stands to reason you have more people going in who are going to shop,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Water Tower Place has a number of tenants targeting young customers, including Forever 21, Hollister Co. and American Eagle Outfitters. Arcade and bar Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s is  seeking to move its Gold Coast location to the mall.</p>, <p>Asked if he worried the ID checks would be a turnoff for tourists or teen shoppers, Hopkins said he wants Water Tower to succeed but approaches the issue \u201csolely from a public safety standpoint.\u201d</p>, <p>John Chikow, president and CEO of the Magnificent Mile Association, said it\u2019s too soon to say how the businesses  the group represents will react, or whether the policy will prevent disturbances in the shopping district.</p>, <p>\u201cWe stand behind our members determining what\u2019s best for their business in terms of creating a positive experience for their patrons,\u201d Chikow said.</p>, <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois has concerns about how malls like Water Tower Place apply age restrictions,  spokesman Ed Yohnka said.</p>, <p>\u201cIs it going to be applied equally to young people from the North Side of Chicago attending a movie as to a group from the South and West sides coming because one wants to buy a gift for their girlfriend or mother? Once these kinds of rules are in place, there\u2019s too much of an opportunity here for some sort of racial inequality,\u201d he said.</p>, <p><em><a href="mailto:lzumbach@chicagotribune.com" target="_blank">lzumbach@chicagotribune.com</a></em></p>, <p><em>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenzumbach" target="_blank">@laurenzumbach</a></em></p>, <p><strong>MORE COVERAGE</strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ford-city-youth-escort-0107-biz-20150107-story.html">Ford City Mall to require supervision of teens on Friday, Saturday nights \xbb</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-loop-security-20180228-story.html">Armed private guards will patrol State Street to aid security downtown \xbb</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-wicker-park-bucktown-safety-patrol-20180318-story.html">Wicker Park, Bucktown businesses to use employees to patrol streets \xbb</a></strong></p>]

At a startup incubator in the western part of the city, an international team recently launched an app called SPRT, which connects sports enthusiasts.</p>, <p>Amy Cooper, a 20-year-old SPRT employee who moved to Germany from Britain last June, complains that Berlin's Internet speed is so slow, it feels like the old dial-up days she has heard her parents reminisce about.</p>, <p>"We're working in a coworking office where there's loads of startups, everything's online," Cooper says. "We use it every second of the day, so it's important for us that it works and that it's reliable. And most of the time, it's not, and that can be really frustrating."</p>, <p>Germany is Europe's largest economy, but business leaders warn it is in danger of losing its edge because of sluggish Internet connections. While other countries are thinking about whether to upgrade their cellphone systems to 5G, Germany is still grappling with 3G.</p>, <p>A <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-land-of-woefully-slow-internet/a-42195241">report by Germany's Federal Network Agency</a> last year showed that 29 percent of German Internet users reported Internet speeds of less than half of what was promised by service providers.</p>, <p>Claudia Engfeld of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and Industry says 70 percent of the city's businesses have complained to her office about slow and inadequate broadband. Engfeld says it's not only an issue for new tech companies, but also for the city's established <em>Mittelstand</em> (midsize) engineering firms.</p>, <p>"If you are doing 3D printing on an industrial level, you'll need to be fast," Engfeld says. "You can't wait two days till your machine has communicated to the printer to do something. This is a disadvantage that Berlin-based entrepreneurs have in comparison to other cities throughout the world."</p>, <p>The Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://breitbandatlas.berlin/">launched an online map </a>tracking where subpar broadband is affecting businesses in the city. Since last summer, more than 4,000 companies have contributed to the map, pinpointing areas with connectivity problems.</p>, <p>Engfeld says in some parts of Berlin, connections are so patchy that companies have had to move or ask staff to work from home, where Internet reliability is greater. Engfeld says having access to a good connection depends on luck, and how far you are from a distribution box.</p>, <p>\n                A cabinet containing components of a broadband network using optical fiber is on display at Germany's Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.\n                \n                <b aria-label="Image credit" class="credit">\n                    \n                    John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                </b>\n<b class="hide-caption"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n</p>, <p class="caption">A cabinet containing components of a broadband network using optical fiber is on display at Germany's Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.</p>, <p>Many CEOs blame Deutsche Telekom, the former state provider, which still dominates the domestic telecommunications market. Instead of installing fiber-optic cables, Deutsche Telekom has been fixing and improving its old copper telephone system, a process the telecommunications giant calls "vectoring."</p>, <p>Engfeld says relying on old technology this way is the problem.</p>, <p>"In Germany, you will find almost everywhere copper cable that's not capable to go faster than 250 megabits per second," she says. "The average reality is about 50 megabits per second. That's quite poor."</p>, <p>According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, less than 2 percent of Germany's broadband connections are carried by pure fiber-optic systems. Deutsche Telekom spokesperson Georg von Wagner insists that most customers don't need anything near speeds of 1 gigabit per second, the standard speed Germany can offer with pure fiber optics.</p>, <p>"Of course we could have decided, four or five years ago, to get rid of the copper wires and we could have replaced them with fiber-optic cables. If we had gone this route, 10 to 15 percent of German households would now have access to download speeds of up to 1 gigabit a second," von Wagner says.</p>, <p>But, he says, fiber-optic coverage is expensive and would benefit relatively few customers. "The rest of the country would only have an average download connection of 16 megabits," he says. "Instead, by improving the old copper wiring, 80 percent of households in Germany have access to download speeds of up to 50 megabits per second."</p>, <p>Tech policy journalist Tomas Rudl says Deutsche Telekom's fiber-optic strategy \u2014 or lack of one \u2014 was shortsighted but was meant to save money.</p>, <p>"Deutsche Telekom's reasons for investing in the old copper wires makes complete financial sense," Rudl says. "It's much less expensive to rig the older tech than it is to dig deep into the ground and install fiber-optic cables."</p>, <p>He stresses that the government also has to take its share of the blame. "Although Deutsche Telekom was privatized, the state is still one of its major shareholders," Rudl says. "So it's within the government's own interests to ensure that its infrastructure policies and funding benefit a major German job provider."</p>, <p>But the government now sees the benefits and necessity of fiber optics. Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet has promised to help subsidize the rollout of fiber-optic broadband by 2025.</p>, <p>For Cooper at the SPRT startup, a 2025 rollout seems too little, too late. It's bad enough that the Internet goes down regularly at her office, but the creaky network also supports mobile phones and she is concerned SPRT's customers can't get the coverage they need to use the app she helped create.</p>, <p>"Should you really have to think about those things in Berlin," she asks, "one of the biggest and most important tech cities in Europe?"</p>, <p class="left">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>, <p class="right"><a href="/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>]

[<p class="Text_Body">Delta Air Lines' shares plunged the most in more than three years, pulling rivals lower, after disappointing ticket pricing forced the carrier to cut its revenue forecasts for the second time in two months.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">Fourth-quarter revenue from each seat flown a mile, or unit revenue, will rise 3 percent from a year earlier, the Atlanta-based airline said in a regulatory filing Thursday. Delta previously forecast a 3.5 percent gain.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">The news added to investor concerns that weaker pricing and the possibility for slowing global demand from trade wars could weigh on profits this year. The timing \u2014 coming only three weeks after a Delta update on Dec. 13 and following the busy holiday travel season \u2014 may have magnified investors' alarm, said Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">"We do not believe that the sharp sell-off in the U.S. airline shares beyond general market weakness is warranted, albeit understandable given the optics on a day with ample supply of negative headlines," she said in a note. Delta's reduced revenue outlook doesn't indicate general industry weakness, Syth wrote.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">Buckingham Research Group analyst Dan McKenzie called Delta's adjustment "a blip, not a major revenue stumbling block."</p>, <p class="Text_Body">The unit-revenue change would reduce fourth-quarter profit by 4 cents from the $1.30 a share previously expected, according to Syth's estimates. Delta was the first major carrier to comment on December trends and will report financial results later this month.<div class="related-media ">\n<div class="related-media-wrapper is-"><!-- add .is-photo, .is-gallery, .is-graphic, .is-video -->\n<div id="strib-image-280714522">\n<script type="text/javascript">\n                    StarTribune.react.singleImage('strib-image-280714522', {\n                        photo: {"url":"http:\\/\\/stmedia.startribune.com\\/images\\/ows_154656001854525.jpg","caption":"Delta\\u2019s hub in Salt Lake City.

Shares in other airlines fell sharply as well, bringing a Standard &amp; Poor's index of airlines down 5.9 percent, the worst performing group on the S&amp;P 500. The rout came amid a broad slump after Apple cut its sales outlook and weak U.S. manufacturing data was released.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">"The pace of improvement in late December was more modest than anticipated," Delta said of average fares per mile. Demand from business and leisure travelers remained "healthy" in the quarter. Total revenue will rise about 7 percent, the carrier said, instead of the 7.5 percent that had been anticipated.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">Given the timing of Christmas in 2018, investors may have expected that business travel would stay strong through Dec. 21, said Helane Becker, a Cowen Inc. analyst. "That appears not to have happened for Delta," she said in a note to investors.</p>, <p class="Text_Body">The airline narrowed its outlook for fourth-quarter profit to $1.25 to $1.30 a share, the high end of its earlier expectation.</p>, <p>StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually\n                            respectful exchanges over news topics.

The Institute for Supply Management reported that its index of factory activity<a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-factory-sector-growth-pulled-back-in-december-11546530431?mod=article_inline"> fell to 54.1 in December</a> from November\u2019s 59.3\u2014well below the 57.9 economists had expected and the biggest drop in a decade.</p>, <p>This was bad news for a stock market already smarting after\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            <a href="https://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL">Apple</a>\n<span class="company-name-type"> Inc.</span>\n<a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revises-guidance-sees-lower-revenue-in-fiscal-1st-quarter-11546465050?mod=article_inline"> slashed its quarterly revenue forecast </a>on shrinking Chinese demand, but less of a surprise as it seemed at first blush. Regional manufacturing surveys suggested the national ISM index was in for a stark drop, yet many may not have been incorporated in published forecasts for the simple reason that they were on break for the holidays. In fact, many economists who explicitly factored regional data into their models had lower forecasts than the consensus. Morgan Stanley had 55.6, for example.</p>, <p>That doesn\u2019t make the drop in the manufacturing index any better, but it is hard know just how much to worry. First, 54.1 is still well above the level of 50 that marks the dividing line between manufacturing expansion and contraction. Second, like most survey-based measures, the ISM index doesn\u2019t merely reflect the reality on the ground but also the mood of respondents.</p>, <p>And what might their mood have been in December, when worries about trade were front and center and stocks were plunging? Lousy\u2014but not as lousy as in 1998 when, in response to the financial-market convulsions from the Russian debt crisis, the index fell from 49.3 in August to 46.8 in December. The next year, 1999, the economy grew at its fastest pace in 15 years, a level not seen since.</p>, <p>While there are enough problems looming to expect the economy will, in fact, slow down this year, December\u2019s drop probably isn\u2019t nearly as scary as it seems.</p>, <p class="summary">The drop in the ISM index may have as much to do with manufacturers\u2019 mood as with what is happening on the factory floor </p>, <p class="hide" id="email-scrim-error">An error has occurred, please try again later.</p>, <p class="ty-headline">Thank you</p>, <p class="ty-message">This article has been sent to</p>, <p class="ty-recipient"></p>, <p class="style__column-name_2q_SeZUL5gpEK9-5nObB5R ">WSJ Membership</p>, <p class="style__column-name_2q_SeZUL5gpEK9-5nObB5R ">Customer Service</p>, <p class="style__column-name_2q_SeZUL5gpEK9-5nObB5R ">Tools &amp; Features</p>, <p class="style__column-name_2q_SeZUL5gpEK9-5nObB5R ">Ads</p>, <p class="style__column-name_2q_SeZUL5gpEK9-5nObB5R ">More</p>, <p class="print-copyright"></p>, <p class="print-copy"></p>]

[<p>Most great stock pickers do all they can to preserve their competitive edge. David Webb is trying to make his disappear.</p>, <p>The former Barclays banker isn't opposed to making money per se. After earning about 20 per cent a year from his personal investments in Hong Kong shares since 1995 \u2013 more than double the gains in the city's benchmark index - he seems happy to have amassed a fortune of at least $US170 million ($245 million).</p>, <p>David Webb is pushing for reform. <cite><span class="ojLwA">Credit:</span>Bloomberg</cite></p>, <p>But Webb finds the source of his outperformance troubling. In his view, beating Hong Kong's stock market by such a wide margin has only been possible because of the city's weak corporate governance and lax regulatory oversight.</p>, <p>While Hong Kong ranks favourably in international surveys of corruption and the ease of doing business, a spate of corporate scandals and wild small-cap stock swings have rocked the city's equity market in recent years. The benchmark Hang Seng Index is valued at less than 10 times its companies' reported earnings, one of the lowest levels worldwide.</p>, <p>"Think of me as an expert mechanic, walking around a second-hand car lot in which there are no warranties, and all of them are discounted for the risk of being lemons,'' Webb explained in a recent speech at The University of Hong Kong. By avoiding most of the lemons most of the time "and getting a substantial discount on good companies, I have been able to outperform.''</p>, <p>Webb's no-frills site is required reading for Hong Kong investors.<cite><span class="ojLwA">Credit:</span>Bloomberg</cite></p>, <p>Webb wants to help the investing public steer clear of Hong Kong's lemons, too. Over the past 20 months, he has advised readers of his widely followed website to avoid more than 75 of the city's publicly traded companies -- several of which subsequently became targets of the largest-ever raid by Hong Kong's securities regulator. Stocks on his "not to own'' lists have lost $US16 billion of their value since he warned against buying them.</p>, <p>Webb said he doesn't profit from any of this work, which takes up about half his time. Now 53 and comfortably rich, he's OK with giving away his research -- even if doing so ends his run as one of the world's best stock pickers.</p>, <p>"I don't want to reach the end of my life and say, 'I was a really good investor, that was fun, but I didn't advance the human condition,''' he said in an interview at his home office in Hong Kong's Mid-Levels district, where he works until 2 a.m. most nights poring through financial statements and other corporate disclosures.</p>, <p>His attempts to clean up Hong Kong's stock market trace back to 1998, when he decided to quit working life at age 33 to manage his own money. Most of his reform efforts since then have revolved around Webb-site.com, a forum for his views on regulation, corporate developments, and other market news. The ad-free site is required reading in Hong Kong investing circles, despite a layout that hasn't changed since the dial-up age (Webb's kids have lobbied for an update, to no avail).</p>, <p>Webb, who was sent by Barclays to Hong Kong from London in 1991, has also pushed for change behind the scenes. By his own tally, he has sent more than 1,000 letters to Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd. and the Securities and Futures Commission on topics ranging from company disclosure lapses to trading rules. When he served as an independent director of Hong Kong's stock exchange operator from 2003 to 2008, board meetings lasted at least an hour longer than usual, said Oscar Wong, a former director who sat next to Webb at the monthly gatherings.</p>, <p>"He would pry into every aspect of the exchange,'' Wong said, adding that he generally supported Webb's positions. "He raised a lot of topics of public interest.''</p>, <p>Webb spends hours poring over financial statements of Hong Kong companies.<cite><span class="ojLwA">Credit:</span>Shutterstock</cite></p>, <p>Spokesmen for the SFC and HKEX declined to comment on Webb.</p>, <p>Webb has his fair share of detractors. He has often been too quick to dismiss the viewpoints of Hong Kong's local brokerage community, said Choi Chen Po-sum, a vice chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange in the 1990s who's now chairman of National Resources Securities Ltd. An ultimately successful campaign to end stock trading-fee minimums in the mid 2000s spurred some in the local press to label him an agent of foreign hedge funds, an allegation he laughs off.</p>, <p>There is something more to life than just making money,</p>, <p>Yet even his critics admit that Webb's an unusually astute investor. His publicly disclosed stock holdings - which likely understate his total wealth - have swelled to about $US170 million from $US30 million in 2003, when Hong Kong's exchange started publishing the data.</p>, <p>Webb estimates his annualised gains since 1995 at about 20 per cent, versus an 8.4 per cent total return for the Hang Seng Index. While he declined a Bloomberg News request to view his trading records, Hong Kong market veterans including CMB International Securities Ltd. strategist Daniel So and Accudo Capital Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Manuel Schlabbers have said that his stated returns are plausible.</p>, <p>Here's how Webb describes the basics of his investment strategy:</p>, <p>The reports on companies to avoid are a byproduct of his stock-picking process. "I am looking for good companies, but when you do that, you find an awful lot of rubbish," he said. "Things like the Enigma Network pop out."</p>, <p>That's the name Webb coined for the group of 50 Hong Kong companies he told investors "not to own" in May 2017. Six weeks after he alleged that the stocks were entwined in a complex web of cross-shareholdings that had pushed their valuations to unsustainable levels, 38 of them plunged suddenly, some by more than 90 per cent.</p>, <p>Webb estimates his annualised gains since 1995 at about 20 per cent, versus an 8.4 per cent total return for the Hang Seng Index.<cite><span class="ojLwA">Credit:</span>AP</cite></p>, <p>Hong Kong law enforcement officials and the SFC have since conducted 20 search operations, seized more than 4,000 items of evidence and arrested at least three senior executives with ties to the companies, according to a person familiar with matter who asked not to be named because the details aren't public. The SFC is preparing to file charges this year.</p>, <p>The prescience of the Enigma Network warning has only increased Webb's influence. In October, his research on companies linked to China Huarong Asset Management Co., a scandal-plagued bad-loan manager, sent several stocks tumbling by about 10 per cent. In mid-November, he triggered a $US228 million selloff after highlighting shares at risk of trading suspensions because of what he called a misguided Hong Kong stock exchange proposal to change its listing rules.</p>, <p>While Webb doubts that Hong Kong will reform its markets any time soon, he says the benefits would be enormous: higher equity valuations, more public companies and a lower cost of capital for businesses across the economy. His portfolio would also get a one-time boost as Hong Kong's lemon discount disappeared. Finding mispriced stocks would become much harder afterward, but Webb could live with that.</p>, <p>"There is something more to life than just making money,'' he said.</p>, <p><strong>Bloomberg</strong></p>, <p>Copyright \xa9 <!-- -->2019</p>]

[<p class="">A company that owns two national for-profit college chains said Thursday that it will erase nearly $500 million in debt incurred by former students as part of a settlement with 48 states and the District of Columbia.</p>, <p class="">The deal with Career Education Corporation will resolve allegations that it lied about job placement rates and misled potential students to get them to enroll. State attorneys general began investigating the company in 2014 following complaints from students and a damning report by the U.S. Senate.</p>, <p class="">Company officials on Thursday said they deny any wrongdoing but called the settlement an "important milestone."</p>, <p class="">"We have remained steadfast in our belief that we can work with the attorneys general to demonstrate the quality of our institutions and our commitment to students," Todd Nelson, the company's CEO, said in a statement.</p>, <p class="">Based in Schaumburg, Illinois, the company enrolls about 34,000 students across two chains, Colorado Technical University and American InterContinental University. More than 90 percent of its students are enrolled through online courses, according to the company.</p>, <p class="">The deal was signed by every state except California, which is negotiating a separate agreement of its own, and New York, which previously settled with the company.</p>, <p class="">Of the $493 million in debt being wiped out, the greatest share comes from borrowers in Florida, which will get $68 million in relief, followed by Texas, with $51 million. The debt stems from institutional loans the company issued to students.</p>, <p class="">Other terms of the deal require the company to pay $5 million to states to cover the cost of their investigations, and the company will now be required to give all prospective students a single-page disclosure with information including job placement rates, anticipated costs and the average earnings of graduates.</p>, <p class="">State attorneys general called the agreement a victory for students, saying it will provide debt relief to more than 179,000 borrowers across the country. In Illinois, where $48 million will be cleared, Attorney General Lisa Madigan said it's a fair outcome for students who were deceived by the company's schools.</p>, <p class="">"Today's settlement ensures the company treats students the way they should have been all along \u2014 with honesty and respect for their futures," Madigan said.</p>, <p class="">At its peak, Career Education Corporation ranked among the largest for-profit college companies in the nation, enrolling more than 100,000 students at several chains including Sanford-Brown College and Le Cordon Bleu, a group of culinary schools.</p>, <p class="">But after years of government scrutiny and deep enrollment declines, the company announced in 2015 it would begin closing or selling most of its schools.</p>, <p class="">Aside from the state investigations, the company has also been the subject of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry since 2015, according to company records filed in September with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The FTC has been examining potential deception in advertising, according to the company, which says it is cooperating with the inquiry.</p>, <p class="">The for-profit college industry faced a heavy crackdown under President Barack Obama but has seen <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/profit-colleges-struggle-despite-assist-betsy-devos-n863641" target="_blank">a shift in its favor </a> under President Donald Trump. Over the last two years, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has sought to loosen regulation and reverse policies created under the previous administration.</p>, <p class="lastMarkupItem">But the sector has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks following the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/major-profit-college-chain-abruptly-announces-closure-dozens-schools-n944696" target="_blank">abrupt closure</a> of Education Corporation of America, which was one of the nation's largest chains before it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/students-stunned-after-major-profit-college-chain-closes-they-re-n944976" target="_blank">collapsed amid deep financial trouble</a>. Democrats have cited the closure as evidence that the industry needs sharper oversight.</p>, <p class="copyright___3CuB7 founders-mono f2 lh-none ls-tight">\xa9 <!-- -->2019<!-- --> NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]

There are more drivers of money to be transporters, money counter and preparer in the strike, as the Union had expected. A number of banks were, therefore, no fresh cash, the dealer could let the day\u2019s receipts do not pick up. </p>, <p class="atc-text paragraph"> \u201chold on a Nationwide basis, the impact for consumers is limited,\u201d said Silke Wollmann, a spokesman for the Federal Association of German money and valuables services (BDGW). Especially in the Eastern l\xe4nder, the participation to the Strike was in many places low or even zero. In Bavaria, by contrast, around 80 percent of the planned money shipments were according to information from the competent Verdi representative. </p>, <p class="atc-text-paragraph"> But what happens if a strike two or three days? In Bavaria, Berlin and Rostock, is approximately the Union announced that the warning strike would continue on Thursday. Whether nationwide on Thursday and maybe on Friday will continue the strike, but according to Peukes. \u201cThe mood is such that people want to continue with this tomorrow,\u201d said Peukes. \u201cBut there are also sites that just want to go on strike for a day.\u201d In Hamburg, the Verdi representative said that for Thursday for the time being, no further industrial action was planned, was to exclude it. </p>, <p class="atc-text paragraph"> \u201cThere is no cash shortage in the trade or overflowing vaults in the supermarkets \u2013 even in three days of Strike,\u201d said BDGW spokeswoman wool man. It could happen that a machine time the Bills went out and customers would have to then go to the next. </p>, <p class="atc-text-paragraph"> Similarly, the German banking industry expressed as a representation of the interests of the five banking associations. There is no evidence for a greater impact, in some areas, it could lead to restrictions in the supply of cash at ATMs, it said. </p>]

[<p id="site-description">Market Research at your Fingertips</p>, <p class="menu-toggle"></p>, <p>According to the market report published by Future Market Insights titled\xa0<strong>\u2018Snow Boots Market: Global Industry Analysis 2013-2017 and Opportunity Assessment 2018-2027</strong>,<strong>\u2019</strong>\xa0the revenue generated from snow boots is estimated to be valued at over US$ 1,475.1 Mn in 2018, which is projected to increase at a CAGR of 3.5% during the forecast period (2018-2027).</p>, <p>Manufacturers of snow boots are focused on frequently launching new products with innovative features and latest fashion as well as the development of innovative snow boots for regions that witness heavy snowfall. Moreover, companies are also expanding their market footprint by establishing organised sales channels in developing countries due to a rise in the consumer demand for sportswear, particularly for the winter season, which are among the key factors driving the global demand for snow boots. In addition, companies in the snow boots markets are expanding their production capacity due to advanced manufacturing procedures, and innovations in the technology used for the manufacture of snow boots. Manufactures are developing snow boots at reasonable prices to be able to keep pace with the growing demand for the same. These are some other factors accelerating the growth of the snow boots market during the forecast period.</p>, <p>In\xa0<a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/snow-boots-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">snow boots market</a>, companies are focusing on various product differentiation strategies to have a competitive edge. In the developing countries, the snow boots industry is highly fragmented with various small- and medium-sized enterprises operating largely in the unorganised snow boots market and the limited presence of organised sales channels. The intensity of competition between the unorganised and organised sales channel in the snow boots market is high. The unorganised sales channel in the snow boots market is prominent in the developing countries owing to the competitive pricing of products from this channel, which is attracting price-conscious consumers. Locally manufactured snow boots are cheaper owing to cheap labour, favourable labour laws and limited requirement of investment, and these are among the key factors driving the snow boots market.</p>, <p>The rapidly growing e-commerce platform is projected to become the largest retail sales channel across the world. However, the e-commerce channel is not evenly distributed worldwide. The penetration rate of this channel is 13%, which is among the highest in the world. Moreover, retailers in the snow boots market need to modify their digital strategies by region, country and category to be able to target the potential customers. Furthermore, in the snow boots market, manufacturers are frequently introducing snow boots specifically for men, which is creating considerable growth opportunities for the global snow boots market in the near future.</p>, <p>The global snow boots market is segmented on the basis of regions, which include North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific Excluding Japan (APEJ), Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa and Japan. Among all these regions in the snow boots market, the Europe and North America regions are estimated to hold a substantial value share. In terms of value, Europe is the most attractive region in the global snow boots market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% over the forecast period. The APEJ region is expected to gain an incremental opportunity of US$ 156.5 Mn during the forecast period. \xa0</p>, <p>On the basis of product type, the snow boots market is segmented into outdoor and sports. In 2017, the outdoor segment accounted for the highest revenue share of 56.8% in the global snow boots, which is expected to continue throughout the forecast period.</p>, <p><strong>Get Sample Copy of Report @\xa0<a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-8181" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-8181</a>\xa0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Key Players in the Global Snow Boots Market</strong></p>, <p>Detailed profiles of companies are also included in the global snow boots market report to evaluate their performance, key product offerings and recent developments.

[<p>The economy has become heavily dependent on financial asset prices. Thus, the recent volatility in the stock and bond markets bear close watching.</p>, <p>These price swings are likely to persist, especially if the Federal Reserve makes a policy mistake. This probability is rising, as Fed members are effectively trying to engineer a soft landing, i.e., a cyclical downturn that avoids a recession, in both the financial markets and the real economy. This is something that has never happened before.</p>, <p>At present, the level of total financial assets as a share of GDP is at a record high. This is troubling and no doubt related in large part to extraordinary monetary policy actions taken during and after the financial crisis.</p>, <p>The Fed implemented zero interest rates, quantitative easing and forward guidance to stimulate the economy. Surging financial asset values were part of the calculus.</p>, <p>In turn, the ratio of financial assets to GDP stood at 4.35 in the third quarter (3Q) of 2018, the last quarter for which official data are available. This was up from 4.31 in Q2 2018 and is up markedly from the last business cycle\u2019s peak of 3.80 in Q3 2007.</p>, <p>A chart from 2002 to 2018 shows exponential growth in this ratio. However, the series looks like it has reached its apex.</p>, <p>According to our calculations, the ratio of financial assets to GDP fell last quarter to 4.29. This would be the first decline since Q2 2016 and the largest decline since Q3 2015. The Fed releases the official Q4 2018 data on March 7.\xa0</p>, <p>With the Fed on path to raise rates further this year (and next) and with the balance sheet on track to shrink by approximately $600 billion in 2019 alone, the value of financial assets is likely to decline further. Monetary policy was much looser in 2015 and 2016, which allowed financial markets to recover.</p>, <p>Importantly, the ratio of financial assets to GDP peaked before the onset of each of the last two recessions. Hence, we wonder whether we are on the cusp of another such decline, with obvious negative economic implications to follow. Why is the Fed not more concerned?</p>, <p>Outside of autos and housing, the economic fundamentals still look good: The unemployment rate is at a five-decade low and real GDP appears to be relatively robust. However, too much of past Fed behavior was geared toward stimulating financial markets.</p>, <p>Given their massive size, the Fed faces a dilemma albeit of\xa0its own making. Tighten too much and the economy will rollover. Tighten too little\xa0and the financial asset share of GDP potentially scales new heights. The central issue then becomes, how best to proceed?</p>, <p>Let the economy run hot, and keep interest rates low in order to stimulate a sustained cyclical lift in inflation. While financial markets could then potentially reheat, a Fed engineered recession would be even worse. Monetary policymaking needs a do-over and soon. We hope the central bank is listening.</p>, <p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Joseph LaVorgna is the chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, an\xa0international corporate and investment banking, asset management, insurance and financial services arm of Groupe BPCE, the 2nd-largest banking group in France with 31.2 million clients spread over two retail banking networks, Banque Populaire and Caisse d\u2019Epargne.</em></p>, <p><a href="http://thehill-v4.disqus.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fopinion%2Ffinance%2F423561-market-volatility-has-the-fed-facing-a-dilemma-of-its-own-making">View the discussion thread.</a></p>, <p>The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax</p>, <p>The contents of this site are \xa92019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.</p>]

"Some of the weakness is due to capacity constraints, with producers again reporting widespread difficulties in finding suitable staff and sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs."</p>, <p dir="ltr">The issue of tariffs imposed against U.S. trading partners appears to be having a negative impact. Williamson said there are signs of slowing demand, along with concerns over the tariffs. Two-thirds of manufacturers are attributing higher costs to the tariffs.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Optimism, which was sky-high 12 months ago, has fallen. Manufacturers\u2019 confidence in their business has fallen to the lowest level in two years. In particular, manufacturers are concerned about how long the growth in new business will last.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Apple applied more gloom to the manufacturing situation when it warned investors that it doesn\u2019t expect to earn as much revenue from iPhone sales as previously forecast. It blamed the drop in sales on trade tensions with China, noting that sales to the country have been sharply lower. Other analysts, however, pointed out that iPhones selling for around $1,000 are having to compete with much cheaper Android devices.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Apple lowered revenue guidance to $84 billion, down from the nearly $93 billion it had previously forecasted. At the same time, Apple warned that its profit margin would be lower.</p>, <p>Join over 300,000 subscribers and receive the latest expert advice, consumer news, and recall notices in your inbox.</p>, <p class="email-rclls__sbttl">Keep an eye on your inbox, the lastest consumer news is on it's way!</p>, <p><strong>By\xa0<span itemprop="name">Mark Huffman</span></strong></p>, <p>\n                \n                    Mark Huffman has been a consumer news reporter for ConsumerAffairs since 2004.

[<p>Come January, many people will vow to eat healthier or get in shape. But, honestly, New Year's resolutions be damned, because guys, <a class="" href="https://people.com/food/girl-scout-cookie-season-start-date-january-new-cookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Girl Scout cookie season has officially started</a> and what's life without a few boxes of Thin Mints, right?</p>, <p>Although the holiday season might be over, there's no need to get into a funk. When one door closes, another door opens \u2014\xa0and that door, my friends, leads to Girl Scout cookies. On Wednesday, Girl Scouts all across the nation got the go-ahead to start selling cookies, according to <em>People,</em> which means people will be able to get their sweet treat fix in no time.</p>, <p>And you definitely don't want to miss out on this year's selection; 2019 marks the<a class="" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/02/girl-scout-cookies-return-new-year-caramel-chocolate-chip/2450440002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> debut of a new cookie</a>, Caramel Chocolate Chip, according to <em>USA Today</em>, which is just as delightful as it sounds. The cookie is gluten free <em>and</em> has a "hint of sea salt," which is perfect for lovers of sweet and savory foods. This is pretty special considering it's been two years since a new cookie was debuted, according to <em>USA Today, </em>so the wait is definitely worth it. </p>, <p>See? 2019 is already bringing good things. </p>, <p>And of course,<a class="" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/girl-scouts-share-taste-caramel-chocolate-chip-cookie/story?id=59929402" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> the classic cookies</a> are still going to be available, according to ABC News. So, people can still get their Thin Mint, shortbread (or Trefoil), and Caramel deLite (or Samoa) fix \u2014 and able to stock up on <a class="" href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookies/all-about-cookies/Meet-the-Cookies.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their favorite Girl Scout cookie</a> that they missed throughout the summer and holiday season. </p>, <p>Girl Scout cookie season <a class="" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-long-are-girl-scout-cookies-available-buy-some-boxes-while-you-can-7844687" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only lasts until April</a> \u2014 which is plenty of time for people to enjoy their favorite cookies or restock on their favorites after underestimating how many cookies they'd eat. But since it has been nine months since you could last buy them, it's understandable why some would want to get their cookies <em>now</em>.</p>, <p>Thankfully, there are a few ways for people to get their Girl Scout cookie fix, even if they don't know any Girl Scouts themselves. All you have to do is<a class="" href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookies/cookies.html?#27607" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> enter in your zip code on the Girl Scout's</a> website, and it will tell you exactly where (and when) a local troop will be selling cookies in your area throughout the next few months. If you're more of a mobile person, there is also a Girl Scout Cookie Finder app for phones that will show you where you need to go. </p>, <p>Aside from the obvious reasons, buying Girl Scout cookies does more than make you (and the people in your home) happy. Purchasing a box of Girl Scout cookies <a class="" href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookies/all-about-cookies/support-girls-success.html?utm_campaign=CookieFY19&amp;utm_medium=Social_Council&amp;utm_source=5Skills_Twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allows young girls to succeed </a>and shows them that people care about their success. This helps in building the next generation of female entrepreneurs, according to <em>USA Today</em>, since the cookie program is the "largest girl-led entrepreneurial program in the world," according to the Girl Scout Association. Not to mention, the profits made during the sale stay local, allowing the troops to experience new opportunities.</p>, <p>So, purchasing a box of cookies will not only support your sweet tooth but will support dozens of young girls as well and show them that they can do anything. </p>, <p><b><em>After a very frustrating first birth experience, this Deaf mother wanted a change.

But coal has long been a staple of the country's energy mix, and Germany looks poised to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-30/germany-closes-last-coal-mine-despite-decades-of-supplies-needed">reduce the amount of coal-fired power</a> on its grid significantly, even shutting down its last coal mine in November. From now on, coal for the approximately 120 coal-fired power plants that still power the German grid will be imported from the US, Russia, or Colombia, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-30/germany-closes-last-coal-mine-despite-decades-of-supplies-needed">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>, <p>The massive year for renewables was led by continued expansion in the wind energy sector. German <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/010319-german-wind-power-output-soars-to-new-annnual-record-on-december-surge">wind power output was up 5.4 percent year over year</a>, and output is expected to increase again in 2019. Alone, wind contributed to covering 19 percent of Germany's 2018 electricity demand, the largest source second only to lignite coal.</p>, <p>Reuters notes that critics are claiming favorable weather patterns, rather than sustainable growth, helped the country produce more renewable energy this year than last year. Indeed, a prolonged sunny summer increased solar output, but the hot year also reduced hydroelectric output considerably.

[<p>SALEM, Ohio \u2014 Although they\u2019d rather have free trade and market access, farmers say the $12 billion in commodity assistance being offered by President Donald Trump is worth applying for, in a year of high yields and low prices.</p>, <p>Known as the <a href="https://www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.farmers.gov']);">Market Facilitation Program</a>, the program compensates farmers who grew various crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and wheat, and for livestock, including dairy \u2014 for price losses due to the trade war of 2018, and retaliatory tariffs that China enacted on U.S. farm goods.</p>, <p>Farmers can receive $1.65 per bushel of soybeans, 14 cents per bushel of wheat, 1 cent per bushel of corn, 12 cents per 100 pounds of milk, and $8 per head of hogs. Sorghum, almonds, cotton and cherries are also included, and the program also sets aside funds for developing new foreign markets, and purchasing more than two dozen select products, including fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, meat and dairy.</p>, <p>The deadline to apply is Jan. 15, and the deadline to certify production is May 1. There is a cap of $125,000 per producer, for livestock claims, and the same amount for crop claims.</p>, <p>But even with the help, farmers question whether it will be enough to cover their losses, and for how long.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not even going to come close to making up for the damage that the market has experienced,\u201d said John Torres, director of government and industry affairs for the Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be most beneficial to farmers is resuming national trade,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Ron Elliott, a dairy and crop farmer from Knox County, said that assistance \u201cdoes help,\u201d but that the program is basically a way of compensating for the market potential that the government disrupted.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019d much rather get my income from the marketplace,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Elliott and his brother, Bob, milk about 130 head on a farm that\u2019s been in the family since the early 1800s. He said farmers will have to do some paperwork, but that depending on the size of their operation and what they grow, \u201cit\u2019s going to be worth the effort.\u201d</p>, <p>In November, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day truce over their trade dispute, halting new tariffs that were planned to go into effect Jan. 1, and vowing to work out a new trade agreement by April. But with the details of that agreement still vague, farmers are not convinced they\u2019ll get back what was lost.</p>, <p>Even if the tariffs go away entirely, farmers and commodity leaders are unsure the U.S. will regain its share of the world market.</p>, <p>Kirk Merritt, executive director of the Ohio Soybean Association, told farmers at the annual Grain Farmer Symposium, Dec. 18, that he hopes they take advantage of the trade aid, and that he\u2019s optimistic the Chinese market will come back \u2014 but perhaps not as strong as before.</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that (talks) will lead to some renewal of that market, but I think it\u2019s probably safe to assume it\u2019s never going to be what it was,\u201d Merritt said.</p>, <p>Ultimately, the U.S. may need \u201cto build up additional markets to make up for what won\u2019t be there with China, even if China comes back,\u201d he added.</p>, <p>The U.S. has made progress on agreements with other nations, including South Korea, through a revised U.S. Korea Free Trade Agreement, and through a new agreement with Canada and Mexico, that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>, <p>There is also strong interest in restoring trade with Japan, one of the key Pacific nations that was included in the Trans-Pacific partnership, which was negotiated before Trump took office, and which he pulled the U.S. away from in 2017.</p>, <p>Trump noted his angst for unfair trade policies during his campaign, arguing that China and other countries were taking advantage of the U.S. through poorly written free trade agreements. But the tariffs hit the wallets of one of his strongest campaign supporters \u2014 farmers and rural America.</p>, <p>Economists with Ohio State University estimated this summer that the tariffs could cost crop farmers more than half their income, if they continue, and that they\u2019ve already cost the U.S. most of its soybean exports to China, which last year bought more than $1.8 billion of Ohio soybeans alone.</p>, <p>While the situation has tested farmers\u2019 patience, and cost them money, many still say they support the president and believe his approach to trade will work in the end.</p>, <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a decent president and I think in the end we will be OK, said Charles L. Kettering, an Ashland County farmer. \u201cI think all he\u2019s trying to do is make this country better.\u201d</p>, <p>David Eichelberger, also an Ashland County grain farmer, said he thinks the president is doing the right thing with trade, but the Chinese, in turn, \u201care hanging it over our heads.\u201d</p>, <p>He said the aid package will help, but at the same time, \u201cit\u2019s kind of a Band-Aid\u201d compared to what farmers are losing in the marketplace.</p>, <p>Katie Hill, the Farm Service Agency director in Knox County, said farmers have been trickling into the FSA office throughout the fall, as they finish harvest. She said it\u2019s important they keep the deadlines in mind, and keep good records of their yield, just as they should do for any FSA program.</p>, <p>Although the compensation differs widely among the commodities, Hill said soybean farmers are seeing some significant payments, because that crop is compensated the most.</p>, <p>\u201cAny addition they (farmers) can get this year is going to help them with the low commodity prices,\u201d Hill said.</p>, <p>The National Corn Growers Association has argued that the compensation to corn farmers should be higher, estimating that corn farmers lost 44 cents per bushel to tariffs, compared to the 1 cent compensation being offered.</p>, <p><strong>Related coverage:</strong></p>, <p><a href="https://www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.farmers.gov']);">\u2022 Second round of trade mitigation payments announced (Dec. 18, 2018)</a></p>, <p style="text-align:center;padding-left:10px;margin-bottom:15px;font-family:'Roboto','Helvetica Neue', helvetica, arial;color:#ffffff;font-size:1.5em;margin-top:5px;">Up-to-date agriculture news in your inbox!</p>, <p class="comment-form-input-wrap"><textarea aria-required="true" cols="45" id="comment" name="comment" placeholder="Comment:" rows="8"></textarea></p>, <p class="comment-form-input-wrap"> <span class="comment-req-wrap"> <input class="" id="author" name="author" placeholder="Name:" size="30" type="text" value=""/></span></p>, <p class="comment-form-input-wrap"> <span class="comment-req-wrap"><input class="" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Email:" size="30" type="text" value=""/></span></p>, <p class="comment-form-input-wrap"> <input class="" id="url" name="url" placeholder="Website:" size="30" type="text" value=""/></p>, <p class="form-submit"><input class="submit" id="submit" name="submit" type="submit" value="Post Comment"> <input id="comment_post_ID" name="comment_post_ID" type="hidden" value="530740"/> <input id="comment_parent" name="comment_parent" type="hidden" value="0"/></input></p>, <p style="display: none;"><input id="akismet_comment_nonce" name="akismet_comment_nonce" type="hidden" value="916ce04d29"/></p>, <p style="display: none;"><input id="ak_js" name="ak_js" type="hidden" value="51"/></p>, <p style="text-align:center;padding-left:10px;margin-bottom:15px;font-family:'Roboto','Helvetica Neue', helvetica, arial;color:#ffffff;font-size:1.5em;margin-top:5px;">Up-to-date agriculture news in your inbox!</p>, <p style="margin-top:10px;"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:.8em;display:block;">Toll-Free</span> 800-837-3419</p>, <p><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:.8em;display:block;">Local</span> 330-337-3419</p>, <p> Farm and Agriculture News, Local Market Prices and Crop Reports, Columns and Commentary.</p>, <p> Hundreds of Auction Advertisements for Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>, <p> Featuring Specialty Antique Auctions, Stores and Shows</p>, <p> Hundreds of Classifieds, Autos &amp; Real Estate Listings</p>]

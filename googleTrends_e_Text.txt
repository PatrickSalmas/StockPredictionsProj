[<p class="c-meta__more">\n</p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It\u2019s been 25 years since <a data-tag="r-kelly" href="https://variety.com/t/r-kelly/" id="auto-tag_r-kelly">R. Kelly</a> first had to answer for sexual abuse allegations. Two and a half decades of new reports, new witnesses, new testimonies, new windows into an age-old story of powerful men seizing the chance to play God while trampling countless women \u2014 girls \u2014 into the dirt. And yet, as a devastating new docuseries lays out in damning detail, Kelly has nonetheless found a way to evade the charges and any real consequences almost every time.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">In six hour-long chapters, Lifetime\u2019s \u201c<a data-tag="surviving-r-kelly" href="https://variety.com/t/surviving-r-kelly/" id="auto-tag_surviving-r-kelly">Surviving R. Kelly</a>\u201d is perhaps the most comprehensive dive into the terrible, tangled history of allegations against the singer yet. The first two episodes dig into his childhood, in which he both was recognized as a musical prodigy and sexually abused himself and his unstoppable rise to stardom, and his relationship to Aaliyah, whom he met when she was just 12 years old. The third and fourth episodes detail the circumstances of the so-called \u201cpee tape,\u201d which allegedly showed Kelly having sex with and urinating on a 14 year-old girl, and the subsequent child pornography case that ended in a surprise acquittal. The final two episodes highlight the reports from the last several years that Kelly has isolated and groomed women and girls into a sex cult for his own pleasure. </span></p>, <p> <div class="admz" id="adm-inline-article-ad-1">\n<div class="adma google-publisher" data-device="Desktop" data-width="300">\n<div class="pmc-adm-goog-pub-div ad-text">\n<div class="ad-rotatable adw-300 adh-250" id="gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section class="c-related c-related--review">\n<h3 class="c-heading c-heading--related">More Reviews</h3>\n<article class="c-card c-card--focus-featured" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">\n<figure class="c-card__image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" style="background-image:url('https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/the-vanishing-keepers.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1');">\n<a class="" href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/the-vanishing-review-1203097498/">\n<img alt="'The Vanishing' Review" itemprop="contentUrl" src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/the-vanishing-keepers.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1"/>\n</a>\n</figure>\n<header class="c-card__header">\n<h3 class="c-card__title" itemprop="headline">\n<a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/the-vanishing-review-1203097498/">Film Review: 'The Vanishing'</a>\n</h3>\n</header>\n</article>\n</section>\n</p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">All of these incidents have been exhaustively reported and dissected in public. Women have come forward with eyewitness accounts of gaslighting, intimidation, molestation, violence. There\u2019s so much smoke surrounding Kelly at this point that he might as well be walking around fully engulfed in flames. This much, even to Kelly\u2019s most stubborn defenders, has finally become obvious. And despite some recent explosive reports of Kelly\u2019s allegedly ongoing sexual abuse, \u201cSurviving <a data-tag="r-kelly" href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/surviving-r-kelly-will-air-despite-legal-threat-1203098870/" id="related_article_link_r-kelly">R. Kelly</a>\u201d is arguably the most prominent strike against him yet. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">But what makes this docuseries so crucial beyond its singularity is its dogged insistence on indicting not just Kelly, but everyone in the music industry and beyond who have allegedly enabled him. As one survivor puts it, \u201cthe reason why he could do it is because he had people helping him\u201d \u2014 and as \u201c<a data-tag="surviving-r-kelly" href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/surviving-r-kelly-docu-drea-kelly-lisa-van-allen-brie-miranda-bryant-interview-1203088434/" id="related_article_link_surviving-r-kelly">Surviving R. Kelly</a>\u201d convincingly argues, he still does to this day. It\u2019s a stark, horrifying reminder that merely saying \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d for abuse doesn\u2019t mean it is, and that fighting sexual violence means fighting a system explicitly built to minimize it whenever possible.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aside from some dramatic musical stings and fades to black, the docuseries mostly eschews salacious framing in favor of measured, thorough documentation and extensive interviews with people from every stage of Kelly\u2019s life. We hear from Kelly\u2019s targets, bear witness to their startlingly similar accounts of abuse, watch them blink back tears as they try to make us understand why they\u2019re speaking out. Driving home just how long this pattern has been playing out is the fact that while some of the survivors are young still, others now have daughters older than they were when they first met Kelly.</span></p>, <p> <div class="admz" id="adm-inline-article-ad-2">\n<div class="adma google-publisher" data-device="Desktop" data-width="300">\n<div class="pmc-adm-goog-pub-div ad-text">\n<div class="ad-rotatable adw-300 adh-250" id="gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">We also hear from the survivors\u2019 friends, coaches, teachers, siblings. We hear from their parents, some of whom remain desperate to hear from their daughters for the first time in years. We even hear from Kelly\u2019s own brothers, producers, and employees, watching them grapple in real time with their own culpability in protecting him over the years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The testimonies are wrenching and furious, brimming over with pain, regret, and determination. And all of them, in one way or another, tell the same story of a brilliant and charismatic man taking every inch of power he got and using it to systematically exploit black women and girls, because he knew he could.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">What\u2019s more, \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d also brings in journalists, culture writers, clinical psychologists, sexual violence experts, and even Kelly\u2019s industry peers to help explain how he\u2019s dodged 25 years of steadily piling evidence. Insight on how Kelly balanced two disparate sides of his musical personality \u2014 from the sex-obsessed player who dropped \u201cBump \u2018n Grind\u201d to the wholesome church ready anthem singer of \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d \u2014 makes clear how he and the industry compartmentalized his professional prowess against the constant chaos of his personal life. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Context on how initial reports framed Kelly\u2019s marriage to 15 year-old Aaliyah and alleged \u201csex tape\u201d involving a 14 year-old (translation: tape of a sexual assault) reveals how unprepared, or unwilling, many were to call out abuse when faced with it. Clinical research, explained by experts with clear-cut patience, sheds light on how Kelly continues to attract women and girls into his orbit despite a quarter-century\u2019s worth of meticulously documented horrors. In these ways, the docuseries seems to both anticipate the Kelly camp\u2019s rebuttals and work to preemptively disprove them, shattering pushback with the blunt force of logic.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight:400;">\u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d isn\u2019t an easy watch; I dreaded pressing play. But once I started, it was impossible to look away \u2014 which is as it should be. It\u2019s been too easy for too many to avert their eyes when the truth was staring back all along.</span></p>, <p> <div class="admz" id="adm-inline-article-ad-x-9">\n<div class="adma google-publisher" data-device="Desktop" data-width="300">\n<div class="pmc-adm-goog-pub-div ad-text">\n<div class="ad-rotatable adw-300 adh-250" id="gpt-variety-article-mid-articleX-uid2"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p>, <p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">\u201cSurviving R.

[<p>In anticipation of the 20th anniversary of the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., ABC tonight will air <em>The Last Days of JFK Jr</em>. \xa0\u2014 a\xa0documentary featuring interviews and previously unseen video about Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, <a href="https://people.com/politics/they-would-love-hard-and-they-would-fight-hard-inside-the-passionate-marriage-of-jfk-jr-and-carolyn-bessette-kennedy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">both of whom died in a plane crash on July 16, 1999</a>.</p>, <p>We talked to executive producer Terri Lichstein about what to expect from the special, and whether the images will make us sad all over again.</p>, <p><strong>ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was this a difficult project? When did you begin?</strong><br/>\n<strong>TERRI LICHSTEIN:</strong> We actually have been looking at this for a while, over the last year or two, collecting these special interviews. What the documentary really does is take a look at his life. At every stage of his life, there are these voices that pull us into who he was and then eventually what happens to him at the end of his life. I love how in the beginning of his story, we talk to his nanny and the Secret Service man who was around him and into high school. We talk to high school friends, two of his college friends, his past girlfriends. Then there was <a href="https://ew.com/article/2016/07/29/cindy-crawford-jfk-jr-documentary-outtake/">the <em>George</em> period</a>, before we get to the day that he died and the whole flight.\xa0This is a very intimate look at his life. We made a very unique arrangement with a photographer we found. When I first sat down and I talked to the producing team, I looked at the material and was like, \u201cI don\u2019t remember that shot.\u201d We really had an opportunity to spend a lot of time with this material and really incorporate it into this entire story.</p>, <p class="tempo-iframe-embed-container"><iframe aspect_ratio="56.25%" class="tempo-iframe-embed" height="360" scrolling="no" src="https://wpcomwidgets.com?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;frameborder=0&amp;style&amp;class&amp;scrolling=no&amp;webkitallowfullscreen&amp;mozallowfullscreen&amp;allowfullscreen&amp;resize=0&amp;replace_attributes=1&amp;fallback=%3Cp+class%3D%22protected-embed-fallback%22%3EThis+embed+is+invalid%3C%2Fp%3E&amp;_data=PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vdmlkZW8vZW1iZWQ%2FaWQ9NTk4ODY5OTgiIHdpZHRoPSI2NDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMzYwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBzdHlsZT0iYm9yZGVyOm5vbmU7IiBhbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW49IiIgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9IjAiIGNsYXNzPSIiIHJlc2l6ZT0iMCIgcmVwbGFjZV9hdHRyaWJ1dGVzPSIxIj48L2lmcmFtZT4%3D%2C4accc0d38c9dcee52bf0f2529372100f7e27232f&amp;_tag=protected-iframe&amp;_hash=f91db6f2193143f16063b214f32bd898" width="640"></iframe></p>, <p><strong>Was it a mistake for him to fly that night?</strong><br/>\n                  Oh boy, I can\u2019t really be the one to answer that question. I think in the documentary, you get a feeling from two pilots who we interviewed, one of whom decided not to fly on that night and another who did decide to fly that night. They both realized the conditions were really bad. I think in the film, you get the feeling that, boy, wouldn\u2019t it have been great if they had decided to go the next day?</p>, <p><strong>Is this going to make viewers sad?</strong><br/>\n                  There\u2019s a combination of emotions when you watch this film. There\u2019s a sense of fulfillment and happiness and the incredible man that he turned out to be. Also there\u2019s the loss that everybody feels that he never got to fulfill his life. At the end of the film, there is this great quote that he gives us when he\u2019s talking about his father. I love it: \u201cOne of the reasons why he remains a figure that captures our imagination is that his life was uncompleted, and his work was uncompleted. There is that sense of promises that were left by circumstances undone.\u201d Here we have this man telling us about a life cut short, which is his father, and he ended up in exactly the same position.</p>, <p><em>The Last Days of JFK Jr.</em> airs at 9 p.m. ET tonight on ABC.</p>]
[<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" datetime="2019-01-03T03:56:01+00:00">3rd January 2019</time> by <span class="entry-author"><a class="entry-author-link" href="https://www.monstersandcritics.com/author/anita-smith/" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name">Anita Smith</span></a></span></p>, <p>Season 2 of the FOX hit <a href="https://www.fox.com/gordon-ramsays-24-hours-to-hell-and-back/">Gordon Ramsay\u2019s 24 Hours to Hell and Back</a> premiered tonight, and his first stop was The Big Easy: <a href="https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/the-trolley-stop-cafe-story-behind-popular-new-orleans-restaurant-on-gordon-ramsays-24-hours-to-hell-and-back/">The Trolley Stop Cafe</a> in New Orleans.</p>, <p>We first meet the restaurant owner, <a href="https://www.monstersandcritics.com/tag/ragnar/" title="Ragnar">Ragnar</a>, who bought the restaurant from his grandfather to keep it a family-owned establishment, draining his savings account in the process. According to Darrin, the kitchen manager, Ragnar doesn\u2019t have the experience to run a restaurant (he was previously an energy consultant), and he\u2019s hardly ever there. Ragnar admits to working from home a lot since he feels his job is mostly paperwork.</p>, <p>Darren thinks poorly of Ragnar, and since Ragnar\u2019s never around, he doesn\u2019t seem to notice. But he is aware enough that he knows sales are declining, and something has to give.</p>, <p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t make this restaurant work, I know that the family legacy will end with me.\u201d</p>, <p>Keeping in line with the show format, Gordon\u2019s team comes in to hide cameras around the restaurant. And since Gordon knows businesses tend to be on their best behavior when he\u2019s around, he\u2019s got to go undercover \u2026 as a cop!</p>, <p>Gordon meets up with actual deputies and they all ride over to The Trolley Stop Cafe together. He finds out that deputies eat at a discount at The Trolley Stop, but that\u2019s not enough to motivate law enforcement from going there. Once they sit down the eat, the three order nachos, fried oysters, a seafood omelet, and a pecan waffle.</p>, <p>Gordon notices there\u2019s no manager in sight. More than half an hour later, their food is ready.</p>, <p>Gordon notices the nacho cheese is rancid, possibly spoiled. He spits out his food immediately and pleads with the officers not to eat the food.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is some of the most disgusting food I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he pronounced. And he\u2019s seen more than his fair share of disgusting food.</p>, <p>(Viewer discretion advised. Those with weak or sensitive stomachs, don\u2019t even click.)</p>, <p><div class="rll-youtube-player" data-id="qb4D17Ms1p8" data-query="start=2&amp;feature=oembed"></div><noscript><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qb4D17Ms1p8?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" width="500"></iframe></noscript></p>, <p>Enough\u2019s enough. The gauntlet napkin has been thrown down and the deputy outfit is off. Gordon emerges from what appears to be a supply closet as himself, in full WTF mode. First things first: Time to announce to the patrons that they are eating utter garbage!</p>, <p>Gordon asks for the restaurant staff to come out and show themselves and notices someone is missing.</p>, <p>\u201cThe owner\u2019s not here? Why?\u201d demands Gordon.</p>, <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sheltered boy who lives with his parents and manages us through cell phones,\u201d answers Darren.</p>, <p>Gordon tells patrons to stop eating, leave the restaurant (group dine and dash!), and join him in the parking lot for some hard truths. Time to watch the video footage!</p>, <p>Cameras unveil staff snapping at each other, a beyond-disgusting kitchen, open containers, flies on food, and finished food sitting on dirty grills. The staff is horrified and the patrons look nauseous (and rightfully so). \u201cI\u2019ll never come here again,\u201d one woman declares.</p>, <p>Meanwhile,\xa0Ragnar shows up in a cop car, for some reason, and Gordon lays into him. Gordon finds out that Ragnar is a former energy consultant and demands, \u201cWhat energy do you put into your restaurant?\u201d Ragnar confesses he\u2019s never helped out in the kitchen, hosting, etc.</p>, <p>Gordon asks the sickened customers to give him 24 hours to give The Trolley Stop Cafe a serious overhaul and asks them to return the next day. Despite what they\u2019ve just seen, they agree. He tells employees to call their loved ones and tell them they\u2019re pulling an all-nighter.</p>, <p>Gordon asks the employees who they think is the biggest problem. Surprise! Darren suggests Ragnar. But he thinks many of his coworkers are afraid to confront him because, at the end of the day, a paycheck is a paycheck. Ragnar seems unfazed by the hate and genuinely surprised by how unhappy the customers are.</p>, <p>As miserable as everyone seems, they\u2019re willing to do what it takes to save The Trolley Stop Cafe. Time for Gordon\u2019s crew to step in and take over!</p>, <p>First up: the decor. \u201cThis restaurant is like an ugly stepchild,\u201d declares Gordon. The restaurant needs a new, clean look. He then goes into the kitchen to analyze the damage.</p>, <p>The kitchen isn\u2019t cleaned regularly. Obviously. Darren thinks the kitchen hasn\u2019t been cleaned since old management was still running the place. Stoves, ovens, and burners haven\u2019t been cleaned in a shockingly long time.</p>, <p>Gordon opens the fridge and discovers moldy food, including the cheese he was served on his nachos earlier. He is livid that Darren voluntarily served him moldy food.</p>, <p>Gordon dishes out some of said moldy food and instructs Aaron, Ragnar, and Darren to eat it. And they actually do. None of them looked like they enjoyed it at all.</p>, <p>\u201cYou should thank yourselves you haven\u2019t killed anybody,\u201d screams Gordon, throwing rancid meat right at them.</p>, <p>While Gordon\u2019s team and The Trolley Stop Cafe team work together to revamp the restaurant, Gordon pulls Darren aside for a quick cooking lesson. He shows how to make traditional Southern fare \u2013 fried green tomato BLT, fried chicken and waffles, pork chops, etc.</p>, <p>We learn Darren lost his father young and his dad was a criminal. Darren doesn\u2019t want to end up like him. Darren, for his part, takes to the lesson eagerly, admitting that he looks up to Ramsay.</p>, <p>\u201cCan you do this? Do you want it?\u201d Gordon asks Darren.</p>, <p>\u201cI want to be proud of The Trolley. I want to be happy at work again,\u201d says Darren, fighting back tears. Gordon can see that. These two have missed a good hugging opportunity.</p>, <p>The feel-good moment is over, and it\u2019s back to work with 18 hours to spare. Darren steps in to train the kitchen staff on what he\u2019s learned, and Gordon decides it\u2019s time to hone in on Ragnar.</p>, <p>\u201cWhy did you even contemplate leaving the energy business?\u201d Gordon wants to know. Ragnar said he wanted to continue the family legacy. He doesn\u2019t want to let his family down, but he knows he\u2019s in over his head. Now he\u2019s crying.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you want to run a restaurant, you need to work in it,\u201d says Gordon. Ragnar needs to be in the thick of it, day in and day out. He tells Ragnar to \u201clead like a boss.\u201d No hug for these two, either, but Gordon\u2019s words are definitely sinking in with Ragnar.</p>, <p>Back to the renovations we go! Gordon unveils the new kitchen.</p>, <p>A Vitamix! Griddle pans! No grime or grease anywhere! A refrigerator with windows! (I want one!) The kitchen staff is super excited for their shiny new toys.</p>, <p>And all of a sudden, Aaron Sanchez shows up! It turns out Gordon\u2019s Masterchef co-judge lives two blocks from the cafe.</p>, <p>\u201cYou represent our city and food culture,\u201d Aaron informs the staff.</p>, <p>Gordon commands the staff to make everything on the menu for him and Aaron. The food looks decent, with one major faux pas \u2013 someone plated raw fried chicken. With five minutes left to the grand reopening. Not good.</p>, <p>Gordon\u2019s managed to wrangle up a second line outside for the reopening \u2013 the small parade included a trolley, live jazz music, even cheerleaders! Even the cops have reported for duty. Gordon comes out to greet the crowd and introduce them to the new-and-improved cafe.</p>, <p>Patrons are immediately greeted by Ragnar!\xa0They venture farther into the restaurant and see brighter, better decor, with matching tables.\xa0 The bar, meanwhile, has been transformed into a ticket booth.</p>, <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m riding in a streetcar,\u201d says one customer.</p>, <p>Retired Saints Player Tracy Porter is there, as is a country singer. Guest appearances everywhere! Everyone\u2019s excited to try out the new eats. The kitchen staff starts making orders immediately.</p>, <p>Ragnar is going around and greeting the guests at each table. He\u2019s a bit awkward, but he\u2019s learning, and he\u2019s making quite the effort.</p>, <p>Moment of truth: What do the guests think of the food? Well, at one table, the chicken and waffles are a bust. The chicken is still coming out undercooked, as is the pork chop. Double whammy: The undercooked meats happen to have arrived at a local food blogger\u2019s table.</p>, <p>Gordon sends the dishes back. Take two on the food: Still a miss with the chicken. Uh-oh. Gordon\u2019s getting mad now, and beckons to Darren to demand what\u2019s going on and to get it together, which he does. The third time\u2019s the charm, and the blogger is pleased and salmonella is avoided.</p>, <p>At the end of the night, customers leave with full, happy bellies, and vow to return. Gordon saves the day! Ragnar shakes Gordon\u2019s hand and thanks him for everything.</p>, <p>\u201cWelcome to our world,\u201d says Gordon. Let\u2019s hope Ragnar sticks with it and brings his energy consultant skills into the restaurant his family has worked so hard to build.</p>, <p>\u201cIf I can get through the last 24 hours, I can get through anything,\u201d says Ragnar. And then Darren and Ragnar hug. They hug!</p>, <p>Three months later, the team checks in.

Love you too.\u201d</p>, <p>As recently as late December, it appeared Diddy was attempting to reconcile with Cassie. The Bad Boy Entertainment founder took to his Instagram Story to share an intimate photo of Cassie smiling in a hot tub -- adding a heart emoji -- which he posted twice.\xa0</p>, <p>But the very next day, Cassie went public with Fine. Cassie shared a photo\xa0of the two kissing, as well as one of Fine posing with her and her mother at a party.\xa0</p>, <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br-vWu7nEV5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">I love you Mommy</a></p>, <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cassie/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Casandra</a> (@cassie) on <time datetime="2018-12-29T17:52:54+00:00" style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;">Dec 29, 2018 at 9:52am PST</time></p>, <p>Fine is no stranger to the celebrity world.

They were for you, but when you weren't for them, they weren't for you."</p>, <p>"And God had to expose that, and it's painful to see people you invested in, spoke life into and believed, now they've shown who they are, and it's because God needed it to happen this year, because they could not come into 2019," the speaker continues.\xa0</p>, <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsJSmX5Hkfm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Diddy (@diddy)</a> on <time datetime="2019-01-02T20:13:32+00:00" style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;">Jan 2, 2019 at 12:13pm PST</time></p>, <p>These days, it appears Diddy is now focused on his family.

[<p>The moment Ben Barnes stepped on screen as Billy Russo in <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/11/netflixs-the-punisher-is-a-brutal-humanisation-of-frank-castle-that-cant-face-its-own-demons">Netflix\u2019s <em>The Punisher</em></a>, comic fans realised that it was only a matter of time before he ended up becoming one of the antihero\u2019s most well-known nemeses, the villain known as Jigsaw.\n</p>, <p>But when we caught up with Barnes during a recent visit to <em>The Punisher</em>\u2019s set during the second season\u2019s filming, he was careful to explain that the path to full-on villainy in his upcoming arc on the show is going to be nuanced, and somewhat different than its comics counterpart. </p>, <p>While Billy\u2019s disfigurement is still a factor in what pushes him to become Jigsaw, <em>The Punisher</em> is much more interested in exploring the fragmented-ness of Billy\u2019s psyche in order to keep the show feeling grounded:</p>, <p>\nAt the end of the first season, we hear the doctors sort of saying that that Ben\u2019s undergone surgery for stab wounds and wounds on his face, so he\u2019s had a plastic surgeon try to fix him. </p>, <p>We\u2019re talking abut a deeply narcissistic character\u2014in season one\u2014whose mask of appeal in terms of doing his hair and the nice suits and all that kind of stuff has been stripped away from him. It\u2019s about what he sees when he looks in the mirror rather than necessarily what other people see, because we didn\u2019t want [Billy\u2019s story] to be a horror show. </p>, <p>It\u2019s something more internal. We don\u2019t refer to the character as Jigsaw in the series, but he very much has a jigsaw puzzle in his brain. It\u2019s not about his face, it\u2019s about the psychological, which is really something we wanted to focus on this season.\n</p>, <p>Though Jigsaw\u2019s very much going to be a major thorn in Frank Castle\u2019s side in the new season, Barnes also insisted that the show is also set to really focus on Jigsaw\u2019s personal predicament as a means of humanising him:</p>, <p>\nIt\u2019s not just about the physical. He\u2019s had his head very much traumatized in the same way that many many veterans have been and he\u2019s trying to deal with that. He\u2019s got brain damage and severe issues with his memory. He\u2019s trying to piece together what happened and who he is, and at one point the metaphor is used that his brain is the jigsaw they\u2019re trying to put back together.\n</p>, <p>With Netflix\u2019s partnership with Marvel <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/12/marvelsdaredevil-writer-i-thought-it-was-too-big-to-fail">seeming all but over with</a>, this is probably going to be <em>The Punisher</em>\u2019s last shot at wowing audiences and figuring out how (if at all) the character should fit into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>, <p>From the sounds of it, the show\u2019s creative team knows that now\u2019s the time to shine by getting a little experimental with things, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until we can figure out whether they gambit\u2019s going to pay off. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/12/heres-your-first-tiny-little-tease-for-the-punisherseason-2">We\u2019re still waiting to hear just when</a> <em>The Punisher</em> season two will drop on Netflix.</p>]

The former <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/tags/teen-mom-og-23625/"><em>Teen Mom OG</em></a> star posted several NSFW photos of herself lounging naked in a bathtub and covered in rose petals. Not a bad life, huh?</p>, <p>Unfortunately, when she posted a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsE_SGDhs9o/">similar pic</a> to Instagram, the haters came out in full force. \u201cBe a role model for your daughter,\u201d one person wrote, while another assumed it was <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/tags/sophia-abraham-38463/">Sophia</a> who took the pics. \u201cSophia is quite the photographer,\u201d they wrote. \u201cShame on you for doing this in front of her.\u201d</p>, <p>Of course, there\u2019s no proof of who was behind the lens, if anyone. Perhaps she just propped her phone up on a table?</p>, <p>The 27-year-old certainly isn\u2019t shy about showcasing her bod on the \u2018Gram, or anywhere for that matter.

[<p class="blog-post__byline">\n<time class="publish-date js-publish-date" data-pubdate-value="2019010306" datetime="2019-01-03T06:59:39">January 03, 2019</time>\n<span class="authors">\n6:59am PT\nby\n<span class="js-authors-list">\nAshley Cullins </span>\n</span>\n</p>, <p>On Aug. 13, 2016, Amber Heard was being grilled by Blair Berk, a top Hollywood attorney employed by her now ex-husband Johnny Depp, in a Century City law office. "Johnny and I refer to his other personality, the part of him that is present when he beats me up \u2014 we call that the monster and have called [that] the monster for many years," Heard recounted during a deposition taken amid the divorce. She added, "I was petrified of the monster."</p>, <p>That 471-page deposition transcript is part of a trove of previously unreleased documents obtained by <em>The Hollywood Reporter </em>along with statements from Heard's close friend Raquel Pennington and the Los Angeles Police Department officers who responded after an altercation between the then-married couple at an L.A. penthouse on May 21, 2016. Heard\u2019s friend Tillett Wright, with whom she had been on the phone before it was allegedly thrown at Heard, had called 911.</p>, <p>The testimony sheds new light on the relationship and will be a point of contention in a court battle in the United Kingdom. The tabloid <em>The Sun</em> is defending itself in a defamation lawsuit filed by Depp over an April 2018 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6159182/jk-rowling-genuinely-happy-johnny-depp-fantastic-beasts/" target="_blank">story </a>headlined "How can J.K. Rowling be \u2018genuinely happy\u2019 casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film?" The article referenced<em> Aquaman</em> star Heard's application for a restraining order against the actor, which centers on that May 2016 night, and said the actress "recounted a detailed history of domestic abuse incidents, some of which had led to her fearing for her life."</p>, <p>The stars have painted conflicting portraits in the press of abuse in their relationship \u2014 even sparking an arbitration proceeding over an allegation that Depp defamed Heard and violated the nondisclosure agreement that was negotiated during their divorce. The actor publicly denied abusing Heard in multiple interviews last fall, and his lawyer Adam Waldman told <em>THR</em> in October that Depp's legal team has evidence that Heard "severely injured" Depp and "faked" abuse allegations. All of which, Heard claims, is false and defamatory.</p>, <p>Heard's account of the events leading up to the split, along with those of other witnesses, will be scrutinized as <em>The Sun</em> defends its story. Heard has asked to testify in the U.K. proceeding, but a source with knowledge of the matter says Depp's legal team has refused to allow it and even threatened to sue her for violating their NDA if she does. That's why Heard's previous divorce testimony could become key, although Depp's camp insists she'll be allowed to testify if <em>The Sun</em> calls her.</p>, <p>There are high stakes in the case, and a different set of legal standards than Hollywood stars are typically used to. In the U.S., the person suing for defamation must prove the statement concerning him or her was false, but in the U.K. the allegedly defamatory statement is generally presumed false unless the defendant can prove it was true. For that reason, testimony about the alleged abuse will play prominently in Depp's U.K. case \u2014 where it is up to <em>The Sun</em> to disprove Depp's claims of what happened that night.</p>, <p>In the deposition transcripts obtained by <em>THR</em>, Heard claimed that on May 21, 2016 at the L.A. residence, Depp threw her phone at her "as hard as he could" and it hit her in the face. She claims he then grabbed her by the hair and she screamed for help. She stated that he "broke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor," and the ground was covered in damaged objects including silver candlesticks and a lamp, among other items.</p>, <p>That's when, according to the deposition, Heard's friend Raquel Pennington arrived at the penthouse. Pennington testified that she'd been in an adjacent apartment and came over after Heard sent a text asking her to. When she arrived, she heard Depp yelling. Pennington said Heard asked for help and told her Depp had hit her with the phone. She said Depp was "swinging around" a magnum bottle of wine and knocking things off the counter with it. Pennington testified that Depp's yelling eventually prompted his security team to enter, and one of the guards convinced him to leave. She also said that she had taken "dozens of photos" of Heard's bruises during the course of their friendship, including on that night.</p>, <p>The LAPD officers who responded to the 911 call that night also were deposed as part of the divorce proceeding. Officer Melissa Saenz, in a July 18, 2016 deposition, testified that Heard refused to give her name, so she didn't realize who the famous actress was until weeks later. Saenz said Heard was crying but she did not see any marks, bruises, swelling or signs of injury on her face. The officer also testified that she inspected the apartment and saw no signs of shattered glass or broken items. Saenz said Heard repeatedly "shook her head" in response to questions and did not want to talk, and that she had no probable cause to believe a crime had been committed. Officer Tyler Hadden shared similar testimony.</p>, <p>Heard testified that she declined to give a statement to the officers at the advice of her lawyer. Meanwhile, Pennington said the officers saw "all of the damage," including the broken glass, and offered to "go arrest him right now" if Heard filed a report. LAPD officers Saenz and Hadden denied in their depositions ever saying that.</p>, <p>Berk, the lawyer who questioned Heard on behalf of Depp, asked her whether she had ever struck, slapped or thrown an object at the actor. Heard said she "did her best" to defend herself against her bigger, stronger husband.</p>, <p>Depp recounted a different set of events leading up to that evening. The actor, in a July 2018 filing in <em>The Sun</em> defamation lawsuit, claimed Heard was "aggressive and violent" and punched him in the face twice the night of April 21, 2016 after he was late to her birthday dinner. The night of May 21, he said he went to the penthouse to retrieve some of his belongings and brought two of his security guards with him because he "was concerned about what Ms. Heard might do."</p>, <p>Depp said he tossed the phone on the sofa and it didn't hit Heard, nor did he touch her. He claimed Heard started yelling at him after he walked across the room and that's when his security guards came in and she started crying. He also claimed the damage in any photos taken by Pennington that show smashed items in the penthouse and Heard's injured face were not caused by him, and that "hardcopy photographs were put in evidence, but neither the original images nor the associated metadata were produced."</p>, <p>While the depositions may play a role in the U.K. court proceedings, the relationship is also being reexamined as the stars' conflicting accounts continue to make headlines two years after their split.</p>, <p>Depp took his claims public, at length, in a <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/johnny-depp-interview-2018" target="_blank"><em>British GQ</em> feature</a> published on Oct. 2 with a cover line teased as, "The divorce. The violence. The excess. The vengeance." In response, Heard's reps called Depp's framing of the issue "outrageous" and characterized it as "psychological abuse." Depp's team fired back, teasing evidence to be submitted in the U.K. suit that would show "Ms. Heard repeatedly violently attacked and severely injured Mr. Depp, and then faked abuse allegations against him."</p>, <p>As part of their divorce, the stars agreed not to discuss their marriage or make derogatory statements about each other. In an arbitration demand, Heard claims Depp violated that agreement and defamed her in several media outlets this fall by giving the impression that she falsely claimed to have been physically abused. The actress argues the statements, including ones made by Waldman on Depp's behalf to <em>THR</em>, were made with malice and she\u2019s entitled to punitive damages.</p>, <p>Recently, Heard penned a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.caae2a57a9e5" target="_blank"><em>Washington Post</em> op-ed</a>, titled "I spoke up against sexual violence \u2014 and faced our culture\u2019s wrath. That has to change." Although Depp\u2019s name isn't mentioned, the piece was widely interpreted as being about him. The actress wrote that she "became a public figure representing domestic abuse" and "felt the full force of our culture\u2019s wrath for women who speak out." Heard says she was told she'd be blacklisted, a global fashion brand dropped her as its celebrity face and it was unclear whether her <em>Justice League</em> and <em>Aquaman</em> roles would remain hers. In response, Depp's lawyer Waldman stated that Heard\u2019s column was an "abuse of the #metoo movement" and claimed she "masquerades as victim rather than abuser."</p>, <p>A hearing in the U.K. matter is currently set for Feb 22, and Waldman says Depp's team will introduce evidence including multiple depositions, photographs and eyewitness statements.</p>, <p>In response to Waldman's statements, and Depp's claims in the U.K. filings, Heard's lawyer Eric George tells <em>THR</em>, "Mr. Depp\u2019s ongoing defamation and violation of the parties\u2019 confidentiality agreement is already the subject of a pending arbitration. We won\u2019t dignify his comments with any further response.\u201d</p>, <p>Waldman, meanwhile, claims Heard withdrew her arbitration complaint and suggests that if she "would like to go to court ... we will see her there."</p>, <p>\n<div class="embedded-content" data-amp-enabled="1" data-nid="1166004" data-nodetype="news" data-template="readmore">\n<script type="application/json">\n        {\n          "nid": 1166004,\n          "type": "news",\n          "title": "Amber Heard on Her Secret Passion, Elon Musk and a Splashy New Role",\n          "path": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/amber-heard-aquaman-elon-musk-dedication-activism-1166004","media": {"width":1500,"height":844,"extension":"jpg","file_size":206742,"mime_type":"image\\/jpeg","type":"image","path":"sites\\/default\\/files\\/2018\\/12\\/thr-photographed_by_ruven_afanador-20181102_thr_amber_heard_s01_203-splash-2018.jpg","orientation":"landscape","id":"1166111","caption":"\\"When you travel ... you can find yourself realizing that, while you\\u2019re never actually alone, you\\u2019ve just gone a month without being around a single person who knows you,\\" says Amber Heard, photographed Nov. 2 at Milk Studios in Los Angeles.

[<p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, an acclaimed English writer, philologist\xa0and university professor, was born 127 years ago on Jan. 3. He is best known for high fantasy works including \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d He died in 1973 and some of his works were posthumously published by his son.</p>, <p>Here are some inspirational quotes from the author, taken from <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/j_r_r_tolkien" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brainy Quote</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/656983.J_R_R_Tolkien?page=4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Good Read.</a></p>, <p>1. "All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost.\u201d</p>, <p>2. \u201cThe world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.\u201d</p>, <p>3. \u201cFantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of liberty, then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!\u201d</p>, <p>4. \u201cThere is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.\u201d</p>, <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/GranthBooks/status/1080741074367401984"></a></blockquote></p>, <p>5. \u201cDarkness\xa0must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.\u201d</p>, <p>6. \u201cIf more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\u201d</p>, <p>7. \u201cFairy tale does not deny the existence of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance. It denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat...giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy; Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief.\u201d</p>, <p>8. \u201cIt is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.\u201d</p>, <p>9. \u201cThere are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go.\u201d</p>, <p>10. \u201cAll your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honor, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the House of Erol and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.\u201d</p>, <p> <span class="figure image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"> <picture class="mapping-embed lazysize" height="3334" itemprop="contentUrl" width="5000"><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source data-srcset="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2019/01/03/jrr-tolkien.jpg 1x" media="(min-width: 1200px)"/><source data-srcset="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2019/01/03/jrr-tolkien.jpg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)"/><source data-srcset="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2019/01/03/jrr-tolkien.jpg 1x" media="(min-width: 768px)"/><source data-srcset="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2019/01/03/jrr-tolkien.jpg 1x" media="(min-width: 481px)"/><source data-srcset="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-sm/public/2019/01/03/jrr-tolkien.jpg 1x" media="(min-width: 0px)"/><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img alt="J.R.R.

Just dropping in on the most deranged show on television.</p>, <p>Let me tell you about one of my favorite traditions: at least twice a year for the last four years, I drop in on <em>Gotham</em>, the Fox drama about the early days of Jim Gordon, future police commissioner in the <em>Batman</em> comics, and the various deranged villains who take over his city on a weekly basis. I&amp;aposm being quite literal here: I don&amp;apost keep up with <em>Gotham</em>. I don&amp;apost watch it week to week, nor do I do a catchup binge. I just swan dive right in, with perfect and beautiful form and probably a snack, and I queue up the last episode that aired, or watch it live if I&amp;aposm feeling dangerous. It&amp;aposs a thrilling way to live. You should try it.</p>, <p><em>Gotham</em> is perhaps the greatest show to drop in on sans context, mostly because it makes about as much sense episode-to-episode as it does year-to-year. What started as a series that was originally pitched as an origin story about cops in a bad city in the years leading up to Batman&amp;aposs arrival\u2014along with the host of theme-party villains he&amp;aposd inspire\u2014has turned into a show that&amp;aposs pretty much Batman without Batman, about all these deranged, horny, and immortal (?) villains that have shown up years early and are extremely committed to stabbing one another. Yeah, Jim Gordon is there but everyone kind of ignores him, and scrawny teen Bruce Wayne is also around acting as a kid vigilante, which never stops being funny.</p>, <p>Turn on a given episode of <em>Gotham</em>\u2014which is streaming all four seasons on Netflix, and kicks off its final season tonight\u2014and you don&amp;apost really know what you might see. Maybe a bodyguard resurrected as a hulking zombie. Maybe a mind control plague is tearing a marriage to shreds. Maybe you&amp;aposll see one of my favorite things, which is someone yelling an answer at the Riddler before he finishes composing a riddle. For a long time I&amp;aposm pretty sure the show had a long-running plot about Penguin&amp;aposs unrequited love for the Riddler. There&amp;aposs not much <em>Gotham</em> won&amp;apost do, except maybe a story about a woman who isn&amp;apost deranged or in a doomed romance. (To its credit, the show did have one of its deranged women take over a portion of the city and declare it a man-free zone, so I guess <em>Gotham</em> is <em>kind of</em> feminist, if you squint some and huff a bit of glue.)</p>, <p>Call it the <em>Riverdale</em> effect: When your baseline for normal is just <em>bananas all the time</em>, it doesn&amp;apost matter what a show decides to do. Being bewildered becomes a feature, not a bug. Of course, <em>Gotham</em> doesn&amp;apost ground itself the way <em>Riverdale</em> does\u2014the latter show is, despite its absurd plots, a standard soap opera with surprisingly stable relationships. All <em>Gotham</em> has as a foundation is that... Bruce Wayne is going to be Batman someday? On the one hand, this is exhausting. On the other, <em>Gotham</em> could probably pull off an episode where a chinchilla runs for mayor and wins thanks to Russian hackers and maybe some hypnosis from <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/bd-wong-jurassic-world-great-leap-profile">B.D. Wong</a>. (B.D. Wong is on this show.)</p>, <p>Of course, there is <em>craft</em> to Gotham\u2014it is probably the most visually distinct network drama on air, with a vision of Gotham City that&amp;aposs a perfect cross between Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher, parody and paean all at once. It&amp;aposs got <em>delicious</em> scene-chewing performances from actors who all seem to be on different shows at the same time, somehow. And it&amp;aposs always going to choose what&amp;aposs fun over what makes sense.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, <em>Gotham</em>&amp;aposs idea of <em>fun</em> involves lots of maiming and falls mostly on the <em>twisted</em> side of things, so it&amp;aposll never be a good <em>binge</em>. But to drop in on? God yes, watch it. Don&amp;apost know what&amp;aposs going? Doesn&amp;apost matter! You shouldn&amp;apost let that get you down, anyway\u2014dropping in on a show in the middle of its run is a great way to watch TV, and we used to do it all the time. You&amp;aposre smart! You can figure it out, trust me. Going backwards is just as fun as going forwards. Take a hint from <em>Gotham</em>, which has never once cared about when things happen.</p>, <p data-reactid="208">Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.</p>, <p data-reactid="295"><!-- react-text: 296 -->\xa9 <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 297 -->2019<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 298 --> Cond\xe9 Nast.

While they may be on <em>Teen Mom 2</em> together, the pair doesn't exactly see eye to eye on many issues.</p>, <p>With a new season kicking off later this month, some fans may be hoping that 2019 will bring a fresh start for the pair. From the looks of things, it's just not the case.</p>, <p>It all started when Kailyn took to Twitter and confirmed a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAshleysRR/status/1080595332960903168" target="_blank">report</a> that says crew members are refusing to work on Jenelle's shoots because they're afraid of her husband <strong>David Eason</strong>.</p>, <p>"I will not be attending any type of reunion on the same day or weekend as Jenelle &amp; David for the same reasons," she <a href="https://twitter.com/KailLowry/status/1080646130977947648" target="_blank">wrote</a> on Twitter.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/21284/teen-mom-status-check-which-couples-are-still-together" target="_blank"><em>Teen Mom</em> Status Check: Which Couples Are Still Together?</a></strong></p>, <p>As it turns out, Jenelle may have seen the comments and tried to set the record straight on Instagram Stories.</p>, <p class="image__credits">Instagram </p>, <p>"MTV doesn't even come to my house to film, where David is. I solely film with my mom at lunches or with the kids and my mom. David is never involved," she explained. "This was my contract 'terms' to begin with. Everyone still has to make a huge deal about David when he isn't involved."</p>, <p>Jenelle continued, "My husband DOES NOT interfere with filming.

[<p>In the 90-year history of the <a data-tag="oscars" href="https://variety.com/t/oscars/" id="auto-tag_oscars">Oscars</a>, the <a data-tag="academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences" href="https://variety.com/t/academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences/" id="auto-tag_academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> has failed to nominate even a single woman in the best director category 85 times. The Academy is not alone. The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. has excluded women from this category in 69 of its 76 years of awarding Golden Globes, and did not nominate a single woman in 2018. We are squarely mired in another year of #GoldenGlobesSoMale and may be on the brink of yet another year of #OscarsSoMale.</p>, <p>When questioned about their exclusively male choices in years past, spokespeople for these groups have typically noted that the nominations are a reflection, not a cause, of the wildly skewed gender ratios in the mainstream film industry. This response is only partially accurate.</p>, <p>While women do remain underemployed, accounting for just 11% of all directors working on the 250 top grossing films of 2017, and 18% of those working on the 500 top films, according to the latest\xa0Celluloid Ceiling\xa0report by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, the fact is that awards season provides an avalanche of intense publicity for the nominees. If organizations such as the HFPA and the Academy fail to nominate the worthy contributions of women, their choices add to the suppression of women\u2019s visibility within and outside the industry.</p>, <p> <div class="admz" id="adm-inline-article-ad-1">\n<div class="adma google-publisher" data-device="Desktop" data-width="300">\n<div class="pmc-adm-goog-pub-div ad-text">\n<div class="ad-rotatable adw-300 adh-250" id="gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section class="c-related c-related--post">\n<h3 class="c-heading c-heading--related">Related</h3>\n<article class="c-card c-card--focus-featured" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">\n<figure class="c-card__image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" style="background-image:url('https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Vice-Behind-The-Scenes.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1');">\n<a class="c-card__video-link" href="https://variety.com/video/adam-mckay-heart-attack-vice-christian-bale/">\n<img alt="Adam McKay On How Christian Bale" itemprop="contentUrl" src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Vice-Behind-The-Scenes.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1"/>\n</a>\n</figure>\n<header class="c-card__header">\n<h3 class="c-card__title" itemprop="headline">\n<a href="https://variety.com/video/adam-mckay-heart-attack-vice-christian-bale/">Adam McKay Explains How Christian Bale's Method Acting Helped Him Survive a Heart Attack</a>\n</h3>\n</header>\n</article>\n<article class="c-card c-card--focus-featured" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">\n<header class="c-card__header">\n<h3 class="c-card__title" itemprop="headline">\n<a href="https://variety.com/2019/artisans/production/vice-editor-hank-corwin-1203097877/">'Vice' Editor on Why It Was 'One of the Toughest Movies' He's Ever Worked on</a>\n</h3>\n</header>\n</article>\n</section>\n</p>, <p>In the coming weeks, the entertainment trades and popular press will highlight the accomplishments of the nominees, transforming established directors into brand names and new directors into bankable commodities. Reporters will talk at length about the helmers\u2019 filmographies, determination to realize a vision and mastery of filmmaking techniques.</p>, <p>When film writers detail a director\u2019s filmography, they connect the dots in the nominee\u2019s films, identifying themes and stylistic preferences. This year, we will hear about how <a data-tag="adam-mckay" href="https://variety.com/t/adam-mckay/" id="auto-tag_adam-mckay">Adam McKay</a>\u2019s films, such as\xa0\u201cThe Big Short\u201d\xa0and\xa0\u201cVice,\u201d\xa0focus on master manipulators of largely invisible systems of influence and power. Because <a data-tag="karyn-kusama" href="https://variety.com/t/karyn-kusama/" id="auto-tag_karyn-kusama">Karyn Kusama</a> was overlooked by the HFPA, we are less likely to hear about her command of the thriller and horror genres in films such as\xa0\u201cJennifer\u2019s Body,\u201d\xa0\u201cThe Invitation\u201d and\xa0\u201cDestroyer.\u201d</p>, <p>Reporters will also effuse about a director\u2019s resolve, recounting the unexpected challenges that were overcome in making the film. This year, we will hear about how Alfonso Cuar\xf3n\u2019s\xa0\u201cRoma\u201d\xa0came to be regarded as one of 2018\u2019s best films, despite its cast of unknown actors and use of black-and-white photography. Because <a data-tag="lynne-ramsay" href="https://variety.com/t/lynne-ramsay/" id="auto-tag_lynne-ramsay">Lynne Ramsay</a> was not nominated for a Golden Globe, we are less likely to hear how she juggled Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s busy schedule and a looming premiere date at Cannes when shooting her tense thriller,\xa0\u201cYou Were Never Really Here,\u201d in just eight short weeks.</p>, <p>Finally, media accounts will elaborate on a nominated director\u2019s mastery of filmmaking techniques, discussing the wisdom and elegance of the choice of lenses, lighting, shots and camera movements. We will read about how <a data-tag="damien-chazelle" href="https://variety.com/t/damien-chazelle/" id="auto-tag_damien-chazelle">Damien Chazelle</a> captured the look of NASA footage from the 1960s in\xa0\u201cFirst Man,\u201d\xa0but are less likely to learn how Chlo\xe9 Zhao created the naturalistic style achieved in\xa0\u201cThe Rider,\u201d the devastating tale of how a rodeo cowboy copes with life after suffering a head injury.</p>, <p> <div class="admz" id="adm-inline-article-ad-2">\n<div class="adma google-publisher" data-device="Desktop" data-width="300">\n<div class="pmc-adm-goog-pub-div ad-text">\n<div class="ad-rotatable adw-300 adh-250" id="gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p>, <p>We don\u2019t notice every awards slight and snub of a deserving director who happens to be female, at least in part because the history of these awards has socialized us to assume that great directors come in only one sex. The awards promote and maintain the make-believe meritocracy that is Hollywood.</p>, <p>Recently,\xa0New York Times\xa0film critic Manohla Dargis mused, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for women to burn down the old movie industry, then build a new one.\u201d Part of that reinvention would include a close examination of the mythmaking machinery that has installed men at the top of the directing hierarchy for decades. Just as many film festivals are now reevaluating the gender makeup of their selection committees and criteria, it makes sense for award-granting organizations to undergo a similar reassessment. Another part of the reconfiguration would involve calling out these institutions when they continually fail to recognize women\u2019s worthy contributions, as Natalie Portman did at last year\u2019s Globes when she pointedly noted the \u201call-male nominees\u201d in the directing category. It\u2019s time to recognize that being left out of the nominations means undercutting women\u2019s visibility as film directors, and ultimately short-changing their careers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">\xa0</span></p>, <p><em>Dr. Martha M.

So we knew that we needed somebody really great and luckily, I had already worked with Ambyr Childers.</p>, <p>\u201cShe was a series regular on Aquarius and I was really familiar with her ability to embody a lot of contradictions in one character.</p>, <p>\u201cI was able to say, \u2018You know, this is an actress I think we can bring in and see a little bit of and then know she'll be able to really sink her teeth into bigger stuff later.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p></p>, <p><a href="/showbiz/tv-radio/1064881/You-season-2-Candace-dead-alive-Ambyr-Childers-Joe-Goldberg-series-spoilers" target="_blank"><strong>IS CANDACE REALLY DEAD?</strong></a></p>, <p class="withoutCaption"><img alt="Candace is alive in You on Netflix" class="swap" data-h="350" data-imgcount="1" data-media1="" data-src1="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Candace-is-alive-in-You-on-Netflix-1671371.jpg?r=1546555878824" data-w="590" src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif" title="Candace is alive in You on Netflix"/></p>, <p>Throughout the series, viewers are largely led to believe Candace is dead and Joe killed her, hence why he keeps having flashbacks to their relationship.</p>, <p>Suspicions grew stronger when Candace\u2019s friend Maddie (Manini Gupta) told Beck people\xa0believe\xa0Joe killed her and she doubted Candace moved to Italy.</p>, <p>Even when Joe showed Beck Candace\u2019s Instagram profile and explained that she changed her name when she moved, it is hard to believe Joe did not kill her as this was not the first time he had been posting from a deceased person\u2019s social media account.</p>, <p>Gamble told Entertainment Weekly that the Candace twist was not planned from the beginning and it was not until episode six that executive producer Greg Berate suggested changing the ending.</p>, <p>She said: \u201cHe\u2019s the one who pinpointed what the most amazing cliffhanger would be that also would allow us to streamline some of the storytelling about the \u201cother women\u201d in Joe\u2019s story.</p>, <p>\u201cSo by the time we were in episode six, when we were starting to flashback and really get to know Candace, we were aware that there was a bit of a misdirect happening where the more you believed that she was dead, the better.\u201d</p>, <p></p>, <p><a href="/showbiz/tv-radio/1066917/You-season-2-spoilers-Netflix-is-Beck-really-dead-Joe-Elizabeth-Lail" target="_blank"><strong>IS BECK REALLY DEAD?</strong></a></p>, <p class="withoutCaption"><img alt="Candace is played by Ambyr Childers in You " class="swap" data-h="674" data-imgcount="1" data-media1="" data-src1="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Faye-Tozer-is-the-favourite-to-win-1671374.jpg?r=1546555878909" data-w="400" src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif" title="Candace is played by Ambyr Childers in You "/></p>, <p>It looks like Candace\u2019s return will be a major storyline in season two of You.</p>, <p>Gamble added: \u201cCandace is just one example of things that we altered in the first season that will have repercussions through the second.</p>, <p>\u201cSeason two does take place in Los Angeles, and there will be a lot of characters and situations from book two, but also we\u2019re telling the continuing story of the TV show, so I think it\u2019s going to be a nice combo platter for people who have read both books and really love them.\u201d</p>, <p>As the return of Candace was completely created for the show, fans will have to wait until season two to find out what will happen next.</p>, <p><em><strong>You season 1 is on Netflix now</strong></em></p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p class="description"> See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper,\norder back issues and use the historic Daily Express\nnewspaper archive.</p>]

[<p>A Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, ol\u2019 Boogaloo Bats. There is a Batman for all seasons. But whatever you call him, he\u2019s known far and wide as a comic book hero who\u2019s managed to keep relevant in entertainment for decades, re-invented time and time again to answer a nation\u2019s distress Bat-signal all. It was camp colors and <em>biff</em>\u2013<em>bang</em>\u2013<em>pow</em> for the 1960s (the <em>Batman</em> TV show). The darkened days of the\u201980s called for blockbuster art deco madness (Tim Burton\u2019s <em>Batman</em>). The world of the 2000s demanded realism and it got Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>The Dark Knight</em> trilogy.</p>, <p>These days Batman\u2019s paling around with some superhero friends (<em>Justice League</em>), or growing up so fast in live-action shows like <em>Gotham</em>, which is returning for Season 5 on Thursday. It\u2019s going to be the final season for the FOX show and will at long last complete lil\u2019 Wayne\u2019s transformation into Batman.</p>, <p>Holy review aggregates! That means it\u2019s time to rank everything we got on Batman movies and TV shows by Tomatometer! (We\u2019re sticking with live-action since a lot of the animated features don\u2019t pick up a lot of reviews. Sorry <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> fans; it would\u2019ve been near the top, too.)

[<p>Another day, another person being lied to on MTV's <em>Catfish. </em>This week's episode featured Dallas, who was chatting for a while with a woman named Safari. Even though they were supposedly in the same city and super into each other, she kept avoiding meeting up with him and wouldn't video chat because her front-facing camera was broken. Yep, we've heard this story before, which means things predictably didn't end in <em>anyone</em>'s favor. But <a class="E" href="https://www.4search.com/bustle.com/where-are-nae-thomas-from-catfish-now-all-his-secrets-came-out-when-nev-max-came-to-town/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">where are Safari and Dallas from <em>Catfish </em>now</a>, post-episode? </p>, <p>Well... they're definitely not together. As revealed in the episode, Safari wasn't actually who Dallas was talking to. Safari's friend William is the true culprit behind the Catfish, and as Dallas isn't interested in men, it didn't go all that well. </p>, <p>"We were on social media drunk, and [Safari]'s like, 'You should totally DM him,'" William said of how the whole thing started. He was nervous, and wanted to put Dallas at ease in a way he thought only a woman could, so he used Safari's photos and identity to work his way into a conversation with him. His ultimate goal was to perhaps be a part of a threesome or other sexual encounter with Dallas that he might set up while posing as a woman... not exactly an honest start to any kind of relationship.</p>, <p>"Most of his fans are gay," William claimed of Dallas' modeling career. But Dallas retorted that wasn't really relevant, saying who follows him has "nothing to do" with what he likes. Nev thought William was shifting the blame away from himself for lying and almost acting like Dallas was asking for it, but William said he wasn't acting maliciously and that he didn't ask for money, and therefore didn't think he was doing any "harm" by lying. William also argued that the way Dallas poses and the photos he shares "target the gay community" and that he shouldn't make money off of those people if he's not actually gay.</p>, <p>Nev conceded that perhaps his social media presence might give the vibe of someone who may be into guys, but that still doesn't mean it's OK to lie and deceive someone. A straight-up conversation at the start about whether Dallas would be interested in William would have saved everyone a lot of trouble.</p>, <p>When Dallas, Nev, and co. eventually met Safari, she and William stuck with that argument. The two seem to think that just because Dallas has a large gay fanbase, it means he should be open to same-sex partners. But not everyone was having it. "I don't agree with you guys when it comes to [the idea that] because Dallas caters to homosexual fan base, it puts some of the responsibility [on him]," Nev said. His co-host, Tallulah, added that though she can understand the thought process behind their points, it's not their place to force a same-sex encounter onto Dallas by tricking him into thinking he's talking to a woman.</p>, <p>All in all, everyone seemed to agree to disagree about what went down. William apologized, and Dallas said he's not one to hold a grudge. At the two-month check-in, they appeared to still feel that way, and said they haven't talked since filming wrapped.</p>, <p><a class="E" href="https://www.instagram.com/flashman.wade/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dallas' Instagram feed</a> (which is <em>super </em>NSFW!) doesn't show any signs of William, Safari, or any other romantic partner, <a class="E" href="https://twitter.com/Flashmanwade?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nor does his Twitter</a>. William's last name was never revealed, and he couldn't be easily detected on social media when searched in relation to <em>Catfish. </em>Safari, meanwhile, is <a class="E" href="https://www.instagram.com/theonlysafarii/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still very active on Instagram</a> (and also has a very NSFW feed), but there's no sign of Dallas there, either, so it's safe to assume they all went their separate ways. Hopefully everyone's moved on to more honest relationships.</p>]

But spending some time sober can actually be incredibly beneficial \u2014\xa0it can help your mood, self-esteem, health, and even your love life. You may just need to get used to <a class="E" href="https://www.glamour.com/story/things-you-learn-from-sober-dating" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doing sober activities</a> with friends first.  </p>, <p>"Inevitably, Dry January will make you work on<a class="E" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-dry-january-benefits-your-dating-life-according-to-experts-7805416"> feeling comfortable with yourself </a>and your own self-esteem," <a class="E" href="http://rabbibregman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shlomo Zalman Bregman</a>, Rabbi, matchmaker, and relationship expert, tells Bustle. "Look, nobody is for everybody. This is part of life! There is no person on the planet \u2014 past or present \u2014 who is or was universally liked. So you might as well be yourself, sober and all \u2014 because the ideal partner for you will LOVE the person that you actually are!"</p>, <p>But still, it can be a tricky learning curve. If you're feeling a little <a class="E" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-dry-january-a-month-without-drinking-affects-your-body-7842987">nervous about dating sober</a>, you can try just spending more time socializing without alcohol. There are plenty of sober date ideas that you can do with friends this January to help ease you into being social without drinking. Here are some fun ideas to get you started. </p>, <p>Just because you're not drinking alcohol doesn't mean you can't drink. Going to a juice bar feeling <em>incredibly </em>wholesome, but it still allows you to try some interesting flavors \u2014\xa0without the hangover. </p>, <p>A group workout can be a really fun way to spend an afternoon or evening, especially if there's a cooperative or team-working element. Pickup soccer games in the park, boxing classes, or even a yoga workshop can all offer plenty of interaction opportunities. </p>, <p>A great day date activity, heading out for a hike is a good, low-pressure social activity. If you're located in a city, you can find a park and start exploring. </p>, <p>Board games are always a fun group activity and, frankly, they can go a lot better without the alcohol. You can host the night and order take-out or have everyone bring some food and mocktails along. </p>, <p>Spas as a group are a blast, because not only are they relaxing and indulgent, but something about the vulnerability of sitting around sweating in a towel can really help people open up. Get ready for some deep talks. </p>, <p>A coffee shop is an easy afternoon activity \u2014\xa0and if you find one with a great food or cake selection, you may find that you wile away an entire day there. </p>, <p>Always wanted to try a live drawing class? Pottery? Get a big group to book into a class together and you'll be too busy to notice the lack of alcohol. </p>, <p>January has the opportunity for all sorts of sports, from skating and skiing to just getting on a sled. It's good, wholesome, fun for all \u2014 and it's a lot safer when you do it sober. </p>, <p>If you want your wits about you, going to an escape room sober is probably your best bet. It's a really fun group activity and you'll be amazing how the time will fly by. </p>, <p>Brunch is the ultimate friend date \u2014\xa0but this time, just skip the unlimited mimosas. They'll still be there in February, don't worry. </p>, <p>Unless you're used to stashing some vodka in your bag, movies are often an alcohol-free experience anyway. Plus, they're a great way to pass a chilly January evening. </p>, <p>If you're looking to pull back on your drinking this month, these friend dates are an easy way to get used to socializing sober \u2014\xa0and you might just feel more empowered and assured at the end of it. </p>]

Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s life and his work has been well documented and explored, but recently things got much more in-depth thanks to a commemorative book aptly dubbed, Jean-Michel Basquiat. According to Artnet News, one of the drawings by the renowned artist reveals hidden messages in invisible ink. New York-based art conservator Emily Macdonald-Korth found the unique details when inspecting Basquiat\u2019s Untitled (1981) for a client.</p>, <p>Macdonald-Korth analyzed the painting under UV and infrared lighting, eventually finding the invisible ink. Macdonald-Korth told Artnet News \u201cI start looking at this thing and I see these arrows,\u201d though the arrows disappeared upon turning the lights on. The piece includes two arrows drawn in what looked like black-light crayon, which are identical to other arrows drawn visibly on the canvas with red and black oil sticks. Macdonald-Korth added: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d further commenting \u201cHe basically did a totally secret part of this painting.\u201d</p>, <p>While it\u2019s not clear if Basquiat intended to implement the invisible drawings, Macdonald-Korth did share that, \u201cthere\u2019s a history there, having something secret there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must have been playing with a UV flashlight and thought, \u2018this is cool.\u2019 It really relates to his use of erasure.\u201d Give us your thoughts in the comments and stay tuned for more on this coming soon.

After another bombing, Terry and Matt are called to action and come face to face with the new cybernetic Joker \u201cBeyond\u201d.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Synopsis (spoilers ahead):</strong> After days of looking for the Joker, Batman feels as if he has searched the entire city. He decides to take a moment to spend time with Melanie. The pair mentions their history together and Melanie reaffirms her goal of continuing down the straight-and-narrow path away from her past criminal activities. The romantic moment is broken with the sudden arrival of Robin stating that another bombing has occurred by the hands of the Joker.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Prior to Robin\u2019s arrival, a random joker known as \u201cCC\u201d walks into a joker novelty shop and reveals that he is on a suicide bomb mission for the Joker. To the horror of Bernie, the owner, the Joker via view screen tells him that he has to go because he has insulted the image of the Joker with his dressing up the Jokerz gang.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Following the explosion, the Joker is with his \u201cThrowback\u201d gang and discusses his disdain for this Neo Gotham and the Batman Beyond. He expresses his need and desire to bring back the dark and gritty Gotham he remembers even if it means evolving his methods. Using a knife, he murders one of his gang due to his boring name (John) and assures him he will be helpful in his grand plan.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Back in the present with Terry and Matt, they head across the city to investigate the suicide bombing. While in transit, the pair is attacked by the gang of Joker\u2019s \u201cthrowbacks\u201d. During the fight, Matt tries to pursue one of the gang into a building but is violently knocked back. Arriving at his side, Batman is shocked at the introduction of a cyborg hybrid mixed with the corpse of the joker \u201cJohnny\u201d announced by the Joker as Joker Beyond.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While a less action-packed issue this month, it was nice to take a moment to explore Terry\u2019s relationship with Melanie (even if just for a few panels). It could be very easy to leave out that plot line to make room for more action so the effort by the creative team here to bring us more quiet moments for the hero to balance his crime-fighting life with his personal life is much appreciated.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Jurgens explores an almost time-displaced Joker which brought up some disturbing tactics. I say \u201calmost time-displaced\u201d as we still have not gotten additional information as to how the Joker is present in Neo Gotham at the same age as we are used to seeing him. That would be my only minor nitpick in that it would be nice to get some hints dropped as to how he is there. Again, a very minor critique of an otherwise solid issue.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>The artwork by Brett Booth really helped bring the Joker\u2019s manic nature and behavior to the forefront and central focus of this issue. You can really feel his rage turn to gleeful joy in an instant even transitioning between two side by side panels. He also handled the quiet moments between Terry and Melanie very well in showing their intimacy and feelings for each other.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Overall, this issue was much more enjoyable compared to the last few of this arc. It captured the psychotic nature of the Joker brought into the future Gotham. Although not a lot of action nor any additional details into how the Joker is present in the future, it felt true to the characters ever-changing mood.</p>, <p align="center">The Batman Universe and all material contained \xa9 2008-Present.

[<p data-elm-loc="1">Daryl Dragon, the cap-wearing \u201cCaptain\u201d of Captain &amp; Tennille who teamed with then-wife Toni Tennille on such easy-listening hits as \u201cLove Will Keep Us Together\u201d and \u201cMuskrat Love,\u201d died Jan. 2 at a hospice center in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="2">The cause was renal failure, said spokesman Harlan Boll. Tennille was by his side.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="3">\u201cHe was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly. I was at my most creative in my life, when I was with him,\u201d Tennille said in a statement. Mr. Dragon and Tennille divorced in 2014 after nearly 40 years of marriage, but they remained close. Tennille had moved back to Arizona to help care for him.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="4">Mr. Dragon and Tennille met in the early 1970s and soon began performing together, with the ever-smiling Tennille singing and the dourer Mr. Dragon on keyboards. He would later serve as Captain &amp; Tennille\u2019s producer.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="5">Their breakthrough came in 1975 when they covered the bouncy Neil Sedaka-Howard Greenfield song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QNEf9oGw8o" title="www.youtube.com">\u201cLove Will Keep Us Together.\u201d</a></p>, <p data-elm-loc="6">Sedaka and Greenfield, a top hitmaking team in the late 1950s and early 1960s, were nearing the end of their partnership and had written \u201cLove Will Keep Us Together\u201d as an ode to their longtime bond. Sedaka himself recorded the song, released it as a single in France and included it on his 1974 album \u201cSedaka\u2019s Back.\u201d</p>, <p data-elm-loc="8">Captain &amp; Tennille\u2019s version, slightly faster and funkier than the original, wasn\u2019t Mr. Dragon\u2019s first choice as a single. He had favored a cover of Beach Boy Bruce Johnston\u2019s \u201cI Write the Songs,\u201d which in 1976 became a signature hit for Barry Manilow.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="9">But \u201cLove Will Keep Us Together\u201d topped the charts in the summer of 1975. It won a Grammy for record of the year and not only made Captain &amp; Tennille stars but helped further revive Sedaka\u2019s career. In October 1975, his single \u201cBad Blood\u201d hit No. 1. Sedaka <a href="https://twitter.com/neilsedaka/status/1080603656507002886" title="twitter.com">tweeted Wednesday</a> that Mr. Dragon was \u201ca great musician, keyboard player and friend for over 40 years. He took \u2018Love Will Keep Us Together,\u2019 made it his own with the magic of his playing and her incredible voice.\u201d</p>, <p data-elm-loc="10">Meanwhile, Captain &amp; Tennille \u2014 known early on as the Captain &amp; Tennille \u2014 followed with a mix of covers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBYV_7a0FQs" title="www.youtube.com">\u201cMuskrat Love\u201d</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpKqvdamEW4" title="www.youtube.com">\u201cShop Around\u201d</a> and original songs, including Tennille\u2019s ballad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ORUZxO0tw0" title="www.youtube.com">\u201cDo That to Me One More Time,\u201d</a> which hit No. 1 in 1980. They also briefly starred in their own television variety show before their careers faded in the 1980s.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="11">Over the past 30 years, they continued to perform and work together on occasion, with more recent albums including \u201cThe Secret of Christmas,\u201d from the mid-2000s.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="12">Daryl Frank Dragon was born in Los Angeles on Aug. 27, 1942. His father, Carmen Dragon, was a conductor and composer who won an Oscar for the 1944 movie musical \u201cCover Girl\u201d; his mother, Eloise Dragon, was a singer.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="14">Mr. Dragon, himself a classically trained musician, played keyboards with the Beach Boys beginning in the late 1960s and was dubbed \u201cthe Captain\u201d by singer Mike Love, who noted Mr. Dragon\u2019s fondness for sea captain\u2019s caps. Tennille briefly worked with the Beach Boys as a backup singer.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="15">Survivors include an older brother.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="16">In 2016, Tennille published \u201c<a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01DAF6YII&amp;preview=newtab&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_OfNlCbNHJRHFV&amp;tag=thewaspos09-20" title="read.amazon.com">Toni Tennille: A Memoir</a>,\u201d in which she alleged that their marriage was far removed from their cheerful hits. They were married in 1975, but Tennille recalled that their marriage was announced in advance \u2014 and to their surprise \u2014 by the record company.</p>, <p data-elm-loc="17">Tennille would allege that the couple suffered from lack of intimacy and blamed it on what she described as Mr. Dragon\u2019s \u201cvery, very difficult family\u201d and \u201cfamous but overbearing father.\u201d</p>, <p data-elm-loc="18">\u201cI kept trying and trying and thinking I could bring this man who has so much to give into the light,\u201d she told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in 2016. \u201cI wanted him to experience the joy that I had with my very loving family.\u201d</p>, <p data-elm-loc="19"><strong><info>\u2014 Associated Press</info> </strong></p>, <p data-elm-loc="20">Read more <b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/">Washington Post obituaries</a> </b></p>, <p data-elm-loc="20"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/edgar-hilsenrath-darkly-comic-novelist-and-survivor-of-the-holocaust-dies-at-92/2019/01/02/9ac45e84-0ea1-11e9-8938-5898adc28fa2_story.html?utm_term=.b74faffad60a" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Edgar Hilsenrath, darkly comic novelist and survivor of the Holocaust, dies at 92</a></p>, <p data-elm-loc="20"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bob-einstein-comic-writer-and-actor-who-appeared-on-curb-your-enthusiasm-dies-at-76/2019/01/02/cac94588-0ecc-11e9-84fc-d58c33d6c8c7_story.html?utm_term=.0d1671f09342" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Bob Einstein, comic writer and actor who appeared on \u2018Curb Your Enthusiasm,\u2019 dies at 76</a></p>, <p data-elm-loc="20"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/gene-okerlund-gentlemanly-announcer-of-pro-wrestling-dies-at-76/2019/01/02/94e3e5f0-0ea8-11e9-84fc-d58c33d6c8c7_story.html?utm_term=.f7fa4145d82f" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Gene Okerlund, gentlemanly announcer of pro wrestling, dies at 76</a></p>, <p id="newsletter-section">local</p>, <p id="newsletter-subsection">obituaries</p>, <p id="newsletter-blogname"></p>, <p class="coded-nl-headline"></p>, <p class="coded-nl-tagline"></p>, <p class="coded-nl-id"></p>, <p class="headline" id="newsletter-headline"></p>, <p class="title" id="newsletter-tagline"></p>, <p class="headline thank-you" id="headline-instream">Thank You!</p>, <p class="title thank-you" id="tagline-instream">You are now subscribed to <i id="headline-instream-thank-you"></i></p>, <p class="newsLetter-error-msg"> Please enter a valid email address </p>, <p class="might-like-lbl">You might also like... </p>, <p class="title"></p>, <p class="title"></p>, <p class="title"></p>, <p class="title" id="all-newsletters-lbl"><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters">See all newsletters</a></p>]

There\u2019s going to be \u2018thank you, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being open and honest and we love you\u2019, there\u2019s going to be the \u2018well, we knew that\u2019 and there\u2019s going to be the \u2018bi now gay later\u2019 people,\u201d Bowens says in the video. </p>, <p>He continued: \u201cI really didn\u2019t have <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="16" id="16">a thought</g> of men until maybe midway through high school, towards the latter end, I had a dream about one of my friends.

I came out as bisexual.\u201d</p>, <p>Bowens says at the time identifying as bisexual \u201cwas a very real thing\u201d and that he chose the label because he didn\u2019t know much about the LGBT community.</p>, <p> \u201cAs you get older, your viewpoints change. The way you look at the world changes, the way you look at yourself changes. Specifically more so in the past couple of months, this past year, I was looking at some old articles of mine because I was coming up with a new character for my wrestling career. And the articles kept labeling me as \u2018bisexual\u2019, and it was kind of annoying me that they had to continually put what I was, I couldn\u2019t just be a professional wrestler, I was the \u2018bisexual pro wrestler\u2019 but I just wasn\u2019t identifying with that term anymore,\u201d Bowens says.</p>, <p>Bowens publicly came out as bisexual in 2017 after his teammates found a video Pavano posted on YouTube of the couple doing \u201cThe Laughing Challenge.\u201d</p>, <p>Watch below. </p>, <p><a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/tag/anthony-bowens/" rel="tag">Anthony Bowens</a><a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/tag/michael-pavano/" rel="tag">Michael Pavano</a></p>, <p></p>]

He\xa0reportedly broke another man\u2019s nose after hitting him in the face.</p>, <p>An ambulance was called to the Hyatt Residences Grand Aspen at around 5 a.m. to treat an unidentified man who was bleeding from facial injuries he\u2019d sustained.</p>, <p>The alleged victim told police that he\u2019d been assaulted. Authorities later took Dallas, who was staying at the same hotel at the time, into custody.</p>, <p>Aspen Police Sgt.

Dallas rose to fame using the now defunct Vine app, and he has since built a considerable fanbase via YouTube and Netflix, which produces the docu-series in which he stars, \u201cChasing Cameron.\u201d</p>, <p>In a tweet, Dallas suggested to his 16 million followers his arrest was a matter of self-defense.</p>, <p>\u201cUnfortunately sometimes in life you find yourself in a situation where you have to protect yourself and the people you care about, have a safe and happy new year, 2019 is going to be an amazing one,\u201d he wrote.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Unfortunately sometimes in life you find yourself in a situation where you have to protect yourself and the people you care about, have a safe and happy new year, 2019 is going to be an amazing one. <a href="https://t.co/VlYur8qyPU">pic.twitter.com/VlYur8qyPU</a>\u2014 Cameron Dallas (@camerondallas) <a href="https://twitter.com/camerondallas/status/1079885695899090944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2018</a></p>, <p>The text, however, appeared to be completely overshadowed by the booking photo that accompanied it.

It\u2019s apropos that tonight\u2019s episode starts with Trina. Her deal is that she is having an extremely hard time getting Trick Daddy to commit to buckling down and finally recording their <em>TNT</em> album, which they\u2019ve been talking about forever. This is definitely going to be the hook of this episode, probably the season.</p>, <p><img class="aligncenter" data-lazy-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwAaliOK1oy0p9e/giphy.gif" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwAaliOK1oy0p9e/giphy.gif"/></noscript></p>, <p>Amara La Negra is back and she blew up since we saw her last season. Now she can take care of her mom the way she always wanted to. Then we meet Jessie Woo, comedian, and host. You may already know her from her poppin\u2019 Instagram. She\u2019s back in Miami after doing some work in New York for BET, and we learn that she\u2019s the product of a strict Haitian family. Her mom, who is a minister, loves her but isn\u2019t really into her career choice.</p>, <p>Let\u2019s fast forward a bit. Jessie gathers some women from the cast and their moms for a brunch. We all know what happens at these\u2014all gossip everything. We learn that JoJo is dating Pleasure P. Then Amara La Negra\u2019s name comes up. Apparently, Jessie fired her manager, who was also Amara\u2019s manager, but he was (allegedly) feeding Amara all of Jessie\u2019s ideas hence the firing. Then Jessie accuses Amara of flirting with her man. That\u2019s when Miami Tip pipes up with info she got from Keyara that Amara was (allegedly) all up in Gunplay\u2019s DM\u2019s too. These ladies obviously want to have a chat with Amara. That\u2019s going to be interesting, especially since JoJo makes it clear that she\u2019s going to hip Amara to game since they\u2019re friends. The other ladies do not like that, but it is what it is.</p>, <p><img class="aligncenter" data-lazy-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7absgcLM5Y4Lfn4Q/giphy.gif" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7absgcLM5Y4Lfn4Q/giphy.gif"/></noscript></p>, <p>Speaking of Keyara, she and Gunplay, who have been on the outs lately, come together to see if they can get right. They cannot. Keyara doesn\u2019t trust Gunplay and it\u2019s as simple as that. She believes that he has been having <em>fun</em> with women in his DM\u2019s. Gunplay denies the latter but he does take ownership of making her feel like she doesn\u2019t matter and agrees to give her space.</p>, <p>Finally, we\u2019re back on Trick Daddy and Trina. They\u2019re about to hit the stage for a highly anticipated performance, but before they step out Trina wants to have a little chat with him. Trina tells him that he needs to buckle down so they can get <em>TNT</em> together. Trick gets tight because <em>he</em> wants to get into the studio when <em>he</em> says so.</p>, <p><img class="aligncenter" data-lazy-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TL2Yr3ioe78tO/giphy.gif" height="306" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif" width="408"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter" height="306" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TL2Yr3ioe78tO/giphy.gif" width="408"/></noscript></p>, <p>He doesn\u2019t really want to deal with this at the moment, or ever, and says they should just get on stage. So, they perform \u201cTake it to the House\u201d It starts off well, and the audience is feeling it, but Trick pulls a sucka move when he notices that Trina is getting ready to perform her own songs. He cuts her mic off and leaves. That sends Trina flying into a rage. She goes all the way off and has a meltdown backstage because she\u2019s tired of being disrespected by Trick. Obviously, the <em>TNT</em> project is over, at least for now.</p>, <p><strong>RELATED POSTS</strong></p>, <p><a href="https://hellobeautiful.com/2983462/lhhmia-recap-trick-daddy-trina-album-barbecue/">\u2018LHHMIA\u2019 Recap: Trick Daddy And Trina Have A Cookout Where The Ratchets Collide</a></p>, <p><a href="https://hellobeautiful.com/2982251/lhhmia-recap-trick-daddy-bobby-lytes-gay-rapper/">\u2018LHHMIA\u2019 Recap: Trick Daddy Is Surprisingly Supportive Of Bobby Lytes\u2019 Music</a></p>, <p class="page-numbers"></p>, <p>SIGN UP FOR THE HELLOBEAUTIFUL NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Copyright \xa9 2019 <a href="http://interactiveone.com/">Interactive One, LLC</a>.<br class="mobile-only"/> All Rights Reserved</p>, <p>Powered by <a class="powered-by-wpcom" href="https://vip.wordpress.com/?utm_source=vip_powered_wpcom&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=VIP%20Footer%20Credit&amp;utm_term=hellobeautiful.com" rel="generator nofollow">WordPress.com VIP</a></p>]

[<p>They say all the stereotypical symbols of romance, like a diamond, are forever \u2014 but some couples seem to be beyond the outward appearances of love, or, at least, the stereotypical ones you might expect. Jada <a class="" href="https://people.com/movies/jada-pinkett-smith-will-dont-celebrate-wedding-anniversaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinkett Smith says she and Will Smith don't celebrate</a> their wedding anniversary in a typical way, and you know what? It's totally OK, because that's what works for them. </p>, <p>As <em>People </em>reported, Pinkett Smith, 47, and Smith, 50, marked their 22nd wedding anniversary on Dec. 31. But that doesn't mean the longtime couple pulled out all the stops and went for the usual symbols of domestic bliss such as red roses, dinner out, or fancy jewelry.</p>, <p> In fact, it's not even clear whether the couple was in the same city at the time of their anniversary. </p>, <p>The actress noted in Monday, Dec. 31's episode of <a class="" href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/?tn-str=k*F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Red Table Talk</em> on Facebook </a>that she and her superstar hubby don't really go in for the whole anniversary thing. Which is 100 percent fine by her. </p>, <p>"We don\u2019t really celebrate that day anymore in that sense, because the context of our union is totally different. Usually, Will on New Year\u2019s likes to be in an adventure in the world somewhere. There\u2019s no telling where he\u2019s gonna be. And I like to be inside. I don\u2019t wanna be out in the world. He now has the freedom to go and have an awesome adventure of some kind."</p>, <p>In fact, <a class="" href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/2184223845174527/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinkett Smith's newest video, posted on their anniversary</a>, mainly covers fitness and Pinkett Smith's internal search for self-love and meaning. The show, which as <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> noted, typically features the couple's daughter, <a class="" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jada-pinkett-smith-kicks-first-red-table-talk-1108862" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Willow Smith, and Pinkett Smith's mother, Adrienne Banfield Norris</a>, features three generations of women indulging in totally open dialogue.</p>, <p>But before you make any assumptions about the Pinkett Smith marriage \u2014 they met when he was starring in <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, </em>they explained on air \u2014 the stars sat down in a recent episode for <a class="" href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/2174148442809253/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">straight talk about their relationship</a> and family life. </p>, <p>The pair, who married in Baltimore on Dec. 31, 1997 and also share son Jaden, 20, as<em> People </em>confirmed, noted on the show that their version of "happily ever after" hasn't come without a lot of emotional work. </p>, <p>Pinkett Smith and Smith got together on the heels of Smith's divorce, they revealed, and awhile after that, Pinkett Smith found herself pregnant and reluctantly and angrily planning a fancy wedding with morning sickness. (Something which her mom apologizes for insisting on during the conversation.)</p>, <p>"'Til death do us part,' is real for me, but all the rules and ideas ... The accepted conventional definition of 'wife?' ... I'm not that," Pinkett Smith added before Smith noted that he credits most of his success to being married to Pinkett Smith and her demand he always do his best.</p>, <p>"The thing with the two of us that never got out is the intention. We were always in sync on a couple of really powerful ideas. We were always building a family, that was our number one priority, family ... As a couple, we are magical," Smith noted.</p>, <p>Of course, Pinkett Smith's candid Facebook conversations have covered a lot more than her marriage, including a recent episode in which she interviewed <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>'s <a class="" href="https://www.romper.com/p/ellen-pompeo-candidly-discusses-raising-biracial-kids-on-red-table-talk-15504965">Ellen Pompeo about raising biracial kids. </a>But the star's outlook on marriage is refreshing in a social media culture in which it can sometimes seem like most couples are trying to look better than the next. </p>, <p>\u201c[My relationship] is more of a life partnership, so it\u2019s not steeped in marital, in that day,\u201d <a class="" href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/?tn-str=k*F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinkett Smith said on the show.</a> I love the honesty, and the fact that this duo not only does things its own way, but that they've made it work so well for so long.</p>, <p><b><em>After a very frustrating first birth experience, this Deaf mother wanted a change.

The film, which was written and directed by Adam McKay, has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards.</p>, <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.npr.org/tags/128526156/vice-president-dick-cheney">Dick Cheney</a> was the quintessential behind-the-scenes political power player. "He really has no signature speech \u2014 there's no great Dick Cheney moment where he was in front of a pulpit delivering a great line," says filmmaker Adam McKay. "He's always kind of just been in the background."</p>, <p>McKay aims to bring the powerful former vice president into the foreground in his new film, <em>Vice,</em> a dark comedy starring Christian Bale. The movie<em> </em>combines the work of investigative journalists with some speculation and comedy (McKay also directed <em>Anchorman </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459344815/on-the-money-how-the-big-short-and-its-jerk-heroes-explain-finance">The Big Short</a>) to tell the story of Cheney's ascent from Yale dropout to West Wing operative under former President George W. Bush.</p>, <p>"I think a lot of the ways that people like Cheney have gained power is that they rely on us being bored. They rely on us looking at what they do and assuming that it's just bureaucracy and who cares?" McKay says. But "when you really dig into it, it's very exciting stuff. And it's major stuff that changes the world."</p>, <p><strong>On Cheney's legacy </strong></p>, <p>The biggest thing he did was by going to war [in Iraq]<strong> </strong>, and then in the end [it] turned out the intelligence was bogus, which I think [whether] you're right-wing or left-wing, I think you have to agree that was the case, and how America just moved on from that. I think at that point we started to get comfortable with the fact that our government wasn't entirely working for us, and that there were agendas inside our government that didn't represent the will of the people.</p>, <p>So I think in an abstract sense, he changed the way we view government, but then, in a very tangible sense \u2014 I mean, let's face it \u2014 the Middle East became completely destabilized. You had the rise of ISIS. They tripled the debt, and then obviously the world economy collapsed. And they were really the first administration who nakedly put lobbyists and corporate insiders in regulatory jobs.</p>, <p><strong>On a turning point in Cheney's life, after he dropped out of Yale, when he moved back to Wyoming and stopped drinking because of his girlfriend, Lynne, who later became his wife</strong></p>, <p>He was working as a [power] lineman in Wyoming. We're talking the early '60s. That's a tough, tough town, a tough state to work in, and what would happen is they would work on the lines all day. They would climb up and put up the power ... and then at night they would go out and they would drink, like old-fashioned, 19th century drinking. He got a couple DUIs. ...</p>, <p>He loved Lynne Vincent from the second he saw her. ... He was crazy about her. [After she confronted him about his drinking,] he white-knuckled it. ... He stopped going into town at night and he stayed in this little crappy trailer with an old World War I veteran, and he would sit there and they would eat, like, canned tuna fish and Dick would ask him stories about World War I, and that's how he stopped getting into trouble and then eventually got back into college.</p>, <p><strong>On the musical number cut from the movie </strong></p>, <p>It was so good. We had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464631594/alabama-shakes-brittany-howard-on-small-town-life-big-time-music">Brittany Howard</a> from the Alabama Shakes. We had the choreographer of <em>Hamilton</em>. We had Christian Bale and [Steve] Carell. ... It was amazing. It just tonewise and storywise did not work in that part of the film, and we tried and tried and tried. It almost worked. I've had a little pang recently, "Man, maybe I should have just left that in there," but the good news is, it will be out ... when the release of the movie happens and streaming and DVD and all that kind of stuff, and it really is tremendous.</p>, <p>\n                Director Adam McKay (from left), actor Christian Bale, producer Kevin Messick and cinematographer Greig Fraser discuss a scene on the set of <em>Vice</em>.\n                \n                <b aria-label="Image credit" class="credit">\n                    \n                    Matt Kennedy/Annapurna Pictures\n                    \n                </b>\n<b class="hide-caption"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n</p>, <p class="caption">Director Adam McKay (from left), actor Christian Bale, producer Kevin Messick and cinematographer Greig Fraser discuss a scene on the set of <em>Vice</em>.</p>, <p><strong>On Cheney's heart issues </strong></p>, <p>At one point he had ... basically a little jump-starter in his heart so when he would have a heart attack it would give his heart a kick to keep it alive and it had like a little computer in it. ...</p>, <p>I think he had five heart attacks, but if you count the transplant [in 2012], if you count the device they put in ... it's kind of hard to calculate, but during the 1970s when he was working in the Ford administration, the youngest chief of staff in history, he was smoking three packs of cigarettes a day and eating a dozen doughnuts every day, so clearly not treating his heart that well.</p>, <p><strong>On McKay's own recent heart attack </strong></p>, <p>We had just finished filming, I think we had wrapped for about a week, and ... I just realized I was not in the best shape. I put on weight during the movie. I was foolish enough to continue smoking ... and I didn't feel good. ...</p>, <p>I was working out with my trainer and in the middle of it my hands started tingling and my stomach felt queasy. Those aren't normally symptoms you think of with a heart attack. You usually think of pain in the chest, in the arm. So I told my trainer, "I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just tired. This is just weird." And he left, and as soon as he left I remembered the heart attack scene we shot with Bale when [Cheney] was running for Congress in Wyoming in the late '70s and Bale asked me, "How do you want to do the heart attack? Do you want it to be a pain in the arm? The chest?" He goes, "I could also do the queasy stomach. That's really common." ...</p>, <p>And so that moment just [flashed back] to me while I was sitting on the couch and I went, "Holy Lord!" and I ran upstairs ... and I just downed four baby aspirin and called 911. ... The doctor said, "Because you acted so quickly you have no damage to your heart." ... So I called Christian Bale a week later and I said, "Either you or Dick Cheney just saved my life."</p>, <p><strong>On how that experience changed him </strong></p>, <p>I definitely started talking to [Will] Ferrell about maybe we have to get back in the saddle again and do a big old comedy, because there's just no better way to spend your life than, like, laughing every single day.</p>, <p class="byline">Director Adam McKay</p>, <p>When I came out of the heart attack, I just had the biggest, dumbest smile on my face for like a week, where I could not stop joking around. I was so happy to be alive and what it does is it \u2014 for me, personally \u2014 just reaffirms what you care about and there's a lot of things I love in life, but one of the things I love in life is laughing \u2014 laughing really hard. ...</p>, <p>It did make me miss the comedy, I got to be honest. It did make me feel that like, maybe there's something to be said about if you can come up with a raucously funny movie that there's just something about that's just undeniable. So I definitely started talking to [Will] Ferrell about maybe we have to get back in the saddle again and do another big old comedy, because there's just no better way to spend your life than, like, laughing every single day.</p>, <p><em>Heidi Saman and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

And one ring to rule them all.\u201d</p>, <p>This is a quick reference to an epigraph in the books that talk about the rings.</p>, <p><strong>The entire passage reads:</strong></p>, <p>"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie."</p>, <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> Social media users celebrated Tolkien\u2019s birthday Thursday.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Happy birthday to J.

This is an actual image from my laptop! Yes, Kids - @jayandsilentbob are coming back! Here's the story: Sadly, Clerks III can't happen (one of our four leads opted out of the flick). So I worked on a #Mallrats movie instead... which also didn't happen because it turned into a #Mallrats series. I've pitched said sequel series to 6 different networks only to find no takers thus far. Mind you, I'm not complaining: nobody gets to make EVERYTHING they wanna make in this business (do they?). And I've been lucky to make anything at all, there's so much competition out there, so many much cooler ideas from fresh folks. And besides: I had #comicbookmen and then @tuskthemovie and @yogahosers (which all came together so crazy quickly), and the podcasts and #fatmanonbatman. With all of that, how could I bitch about no Clerks III or Mallrats 2? Then when I started directing @thecw shows, it was such a slice of Heaven on Earth, I happily put my Askewniverse sequels to the side. Since I sold #Clerks and #Mallrats years ago, they're owned by others, which limits my moves with my own material. I don't mind: back in the day, all I ever wanted to do was sell my stuff so I could be in the movie biz in the first place. So I don't own Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy or #Dogma... But I DO own #jayandsilentbob. So while I love playing with someone else's new toys on @cwtheflash and @Supergirl, I'm getting eager to play with my old toys again in the inter-connected View Askewniverse I spent the first half of my career creating. And so all last month, I had the time of my life laughing while writing "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot" - a fun flick in which the Jersey boys have to go back to Hollywood to stop a brand new reboot of the old "Bluntman &amp; Chronic Movie" they hated so much. It's a tongue-in-cheek, silly-ass satire that pokes fun at the movie business's recent re-do obsession, featuring an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces! And I already met with the good folks at Miramax and they're into it, so I'm hoping we'll be shooting in the summer! Never give up, kids. You CAN do anything you want in life, so long as you're patient and malleable. #KevinSmith</a></p>, <p class="body-text">A post shared by <a class="body-link" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/thatkevinsmith/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading" href="https://www.instagram.com/thatkevinsmith/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Kevin Smith</a> (@thatkevinsmith) on <time datetime="2017-02-09T21:54:40+00:00" style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;">Feb 9, 2017 at 1:54pm PST</time></p>, <p class="body-text">Back in 2017, Smith <a class="body-link" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a820972/kevin-smith-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot-announcement/" href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a820972/kevin-smith-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot-announcement/" target="_blank">revealed that he was writing </a><em><a class="body-link" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a820972/kevin-smith-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot-announcement/" href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a820972/kevin-smith-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot-announcement/" target="_blank">Jay and Silent Bob Reboot</a></em>, a film that is essentially identical to the original and satirises the industry's recent 're-do obsession'.<br/></p>, <p class="body-text">He wrote in a post on Instagram: "Last month, I had the time of my life laughing while writing "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot" - a fun flick in which the Jersey boys have to go back to Hollywood to stop a brand new reboot of the old "Bluntman &amp; Chronic Movie" they hated so much. </p>, <p class="body-text">"It's a tongue-in-cheek, silly-ass satire that pokes fun at the movie business's recent re-do obsession, featuring an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces!

[<p class="article__lede__credit bod-xs m-b-5-xs">Photos by Neilson Barnard via Getty Images and the RSPCA</p>, <p>On December 17, a soulless human <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/dog-tries-to-follow-owner-after-being-abandoned-at-roadside-11591020" target="_blank">dumped</a> a sweet white Staffordshire bull terrier named Snoop on the side of the road in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Footage of this heinous affront to good dogs everywhere was captured on CCTV, released by the <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/home" target="_blank">RSPCA</a> around Christmas, and quickly went viral.</p>, <p>The sad saga caught the attention of the OG Snoop, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5kezx/snoop-dogg-discovers-pine-cone-vgtrn" target="_blank">Snoop Dogg the rapper</a>, who <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/750624/snoop-dogg-adopt-abandoned-dog-snoop-rspca-stafford-terrier" target="_blank">offered to adopt</a> the pupper, inviting him to live out his doggy days at \u201cCasa De Snoop.\u201d But distressingly, the RSPCA doesn\u2019t seem interested in Snoop\u2019s generous offer. </p>, <p>A representative <a href="https://people.com/music/snoop-dogg-wants-to-adopt-abandoned-dog-named-snoop/" target="_blank">told PEOPLE</a> that Snoop the dog is currently staying at \u201cprivate kennels\u201d and is not up for adoption while the charity investigates his abandonment, but has had \u201cscores of people wanting to rehome him so we are certain he will not be waiting long for a new home.\u201d</p>, <p>Frankly, this is an affront to the positive energy with which I\u2019d hoped to begin the new calendar year. If a down-on-his-luck dog named Snoop can't be adopted by a wealthy, kind man like Snoop Dogg, what hope is there for the rest of 2019? How will we accumulate enough good karma to expunge the bad memories of 2018, and 2017, and 2016, until we\u2019re back in the good old days when we had a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/entertainment/obama-billboard-chart-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">president with a sense of humor</a> and spirit of human decency?</p>, <p>Here is an exhaustive list of all the reasons the RSPCA ought to let Snoop Dogg adopt Snoop the dog, becoming the Zaddy Warbucks to his Doggy Orphan Annie:</p>, <p>We, the dog lovers of the internet, can only hope the RSPCA does the right thing and allows two kindred Snoops to become a family. It\u2019d be the ultimate cosmic justice. The wayward soul who dumped Snoop on the side of the road will have ultimately done a good thing by being the impetus for a beautiful canine friendship. </p>, <p><a href="https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/48178908AA2FD075" target="_blank"><i> Sign up for our newsletter</i></a><i> to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.</i></p>, <p><i> Follow Kara Weisenstein on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/karaweisenstein" target="_blank"><i> Twitter</i></a><i>.</i></p>, <p class="newsletter__subheading bod-s">Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.</p>]

It really has been central to the show from the very beginning, but I think now, more than ever, with this reveal that Reddington is, in fact, an impostor and so much of what we've been led to believe has been undermined and eroded," <em>The Blacklist</em> creator Jon Bokenkamp told <a href="//www.etonline.com/the-blacklist-boss-explains-why-season-6-is-a-completely-unique-adventure-exclusive-116446" target="_blank"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a> ahead of the beginning of the show's two-night season premiere. "The question at the forefront for the audience and certainly in Elizabeth Keen's mind is: Who is this guy? Why did he choose me? What is his ultimate agenda? Identity is tangled up in that in all kinds of strange, curious ways."</p>, <p>With knowledge on her side, the cat-and-mouse game between Red and Liz will finally see the latter character hiding things and plotting her own agenda during the new installment.</p>, <p>"The thing that is fresh and unique about this season is that for the first time, somebody is way ahead of Red. Elizabeth Keen knows a truth about him that he doesn't know and she is forced to continue to play the role of his daughter," Bokenkamp told the outlet. "In all of the scenes that they play together [this year], not only does he know he is not ultimately the original Raymond Reddington, she also knows that this man is not her father. It creates a really interesting power struggle and a mental chess game between these two characters who are carrying on presenting stories of who they are and yet, Elizabeth Keen is working in the shadows in trying to unlock the truth behind why he entered her life."</p>, <p>The new dynamic will force fans to notice what both Liz and Red say in the silent moments they share during the case of the week episodes.</p>, <p>"That's a dynamic we haven't seen on the show before," Bokenkamp added, saying that it's "something new" creatively for the series. "Elements of it feel familiar but it has consequences that are incredibly significant."</p>, <p>Another big change for the upcoming season, <a href="//popculture.com/tv-shows/2018/12/07/the-blacklist-season-6-trailer-released/" target="_blank">as teased by the Season 6 trailer released in December</a>, will be Red's incarceration. While the development will affect his mysterious master plan, fans can expect to see their favorite criminal mastermind to still thrive despite the new environment.</p>, <p>"He's in prison and all of his superpowers are stripped away," Bokenkamp teased. "His connections, his money means nothing. He's sort of starting over, in a way. That is going to test the relationships he has on the outside and will likely foster some new relationships on the inside. Nobody likes new experiences more than Raymond Reddington, so audiences should expect that he will embrace this new struggle with open arms. It is incredibly dangerous and there are high emotional stakes, but it's also going to be incredibly fun."</p>, <p><em>The Blacklist</em> premieres Season 6 with <a href="//popculture.com/tv-shows/2018/11/22/the-blacklist-season-6-premiere-air-2-nights/" target="_blank">a two-night premiere starting</a> Thursday at 10 p.m. ET, followed by its regular time-slot premiere Friday at 9 p.m. ET on <a href="/category/nbc">NBC</a>.</p>, <p><span class="slidenumber"></span> of <span class="slidetotal"></span></p>, <p>Entertainment Tonight/TV Guide Network.

Petaluma Blvd.</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Admission: $25</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Tickets: Call (707) 775-6048 or visit MysticTheatre.com.</p>, <p class="first-paragraph">There is a creation story surrounding Paul Thorn, that\u2019s colorful but not entirely true. It goes something like this: Paul Thorn grew up in the Deep South (true) as the son of a strict fire-and-brimstone preacher (true) who forbid his son from playing rock \u2018n roll records (sort of true). So the young Thorn would hide in his bedroom closet and listen to the devil\u2019s music on a small record player (actually, he hid his albums in the closet, but was not prone to spinning platters in the dark, cramped space).</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cI owned two \u2018satanic\u2019 albums,\u201d Thorn says in a slow Southern murmur, during a phone call from Tupelo, Mississippi, his hometown. \u201cOne was \u201cElton John: Greatest Hits\u201d and the other was Huey Lewis and the News\u2019 first album. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cYou know,\u201d Thorn adds, \u201ctwo of the main demonic message carriers.\u201d</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Thorn\u2019s new album, \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Devil Ride\u201d (Perpetual Obscurity), bristles with his trademark blend of gospel, soul and swampy blues. He digs deeply into such country blues standards as \u201cJesus Gonna Make Up My Dyin\u2019 Bed.\u201d and delivers a rollicking rendition of the old black spiritual \u201cSoon I Will Be Done,\u201d custom-made for a rock \u2019n roll revival meeting. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">It\u2019s the perfect mix of the sacred and the profane.</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cIn the faith that I grew up in, there were two alternatives. You either got saved and went to heaven or you didn\u2019t get saved and you went to hell,\u201d Thorn explains. \u201cLike a lot of religions, they used fear and intimidation, which unfortunately are two things that don\u2019t usually bring success in the long-term. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cThe best way to recruit people,\u201d he adds, \u201cis to love \u2019em.\u201d </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">His father was a Pentecostal preacher, which did, in a roundabout way, contributd to Thorn becoming an acclaimed blued-eyed soul man steeped in gospel and blues. As a kid, Thorn sang in the church choir. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cThere were two types of churches in Tupelo,\u201d he says. The black churches and the white churches. Our family would attend both churches. That\u2019s where I learned to play music. The black churches had a rhythm-and-blues kind of gospel and the white churches had old-school country spirituals. Those two things made me everything I\u2019ve become - whatever that is.\u201d</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Ask the 54-year-old Thorn to trace his professional career and he offers, \u201cThat\u2019s a very long story.\u201d</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">After high school, he worked in a furniture factory and served in the National Guard. He also fought as a professional boxer, the ninth-ranked middleweight in the country. Thorn once fought WBC middleweight champ Roberto Duran. The fight ended after Thorn received a cut above one of his eyes. The two boxers rode to the hospital in the same ambulance. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">\u201cI know that sounds crazy, but it\u2019s the truth,\u201d he says. \u201cDuran had more than I\u2019d ever dealt with before. He was a defensive wizard. He took me to school, man. But I gave a good account of myself. The harsh reality was that at my best, I could never beat him.  But I gave it my all. I left nothing on the table.\u201d</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Thorn\u2019s big break as a musician came when Miles Copeland III - the founder of I.R.S Records, manager of the Police and brother of that band\u2019s drummer, Stewart Copeland - heard a demo cassette tape that Thorn had mailed to him. </p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">PLAN TO GO?</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">What: Paul Thorn, with Alice Drinks the Kool-Aid</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">When: Fri., Jan. 18, at 8:30 p.m.</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Where: Mystic Theatre, 21 N. Petaluma Blvd.</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Admission: $25</p>, <p class="IT-AC_2016-BodyText-BodyText_RR">Tickets: Call (707) 775-6048 or visit MysticTheatre.com.</p>, <p class="first-paragraph-no-border">\u201cLike a lot of wannabe singers, I was just sending out tapes to anybody who would listen,\u201d Thorn says. \u201cMiles Copeland got ahold of one and he liked the songs. At the time, I was playing in a pizza restaurant two nights a week. He literally flew to Tupelo to listen to me playing at a pizza restaurant. A month later, he gave me a bunch of money and I was able to quit the day job at the furniture factory.\u201d</p>, <p>Copeland opened some major doors for Thorn, who soon began touring and building up his fan base. </p>, <p>\u201cIt was just like building a church,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go from city to city and win people over. When you come back around, they bring their friends. You keep doing that over and over. You make relationships, you build friendships and you connect with people.  The church experience really taught me how to draw in people and how to entertain them. Just like my dad did from the pulpit.\u201d </p>, <p>Thorn never did record for I.R.S., but in 1997 he released his debut album, \u201cHammer &amp; Nail,\u201d on the A&amp;M label. The album had nine songs with Biblical themes co-written with legendary Texas songwriter Billy Maddox. It also had one Thorn original (\u201cResurrection Day). </p>, <p>Thorn credits his gospel roots with informing his career as a songwriter.</p>, <p>\u201cYou know, rock \u2019n roll came from gospel,\u201d he says, reflecting on the salvation he\u2019s found in his music. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, Elvis grew up singing in the same churches I attended in Tupelo. I mean, Led Zeppelin\u2019s music is just a bunch of Mississippi blues songs with distortion. All that came from where I live.\u201d</p>, <p>Thorn\u2019s music is inspirational, as you might expect from a preacher\u2019s son, and they have a clear literary bent.</p>, <p>\u201cA lot of my songs are story songs,\u201d he says. \u201cThere might be something bad going on in the song, but I always try to figure out something in the lyrics that offers the character a way out. I don\u2019t want to wallow in a \u2018we-can\u2019t-get-out-of-this-hole-we\u2019re-in\u2019 scenario. I\u2019m here to say that you can get out of that hole you\u2019re in, because that\u2019s what the message of encouragement is. I\u2019m a secular singer, but I try to put that same hope in my songs that you find in gospel.\u201d</p>, <p>Thorn says believes there is a time and a place for sad songs, and he\u2019s lived his share of sadness.</p>, <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m living something different now,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be some kind of a light, even if it\u2019s just a small light. I want to be sincere in what I do and to touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p>]

I love his cynicism, his clipped sentences, his ability to see the strings that propel human behavior as clearly as if we were marionettes. Yet, I can\u2019t argue with people who\u2019ve grumbled that he wants his actors wooden\u2014he\u2019s the one guy who doesn\u2019t allow Colin Farrell to wiggle his eyebrows. Personally, I get a kick out of Lanthimos\u2019 Noh-style performances, which force us to pay more attention to the dialogue.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoax00113g5vzgq07ith@published" data-word-count="60">\n          But in<em> The Favourite</em>, Lanthimos lets Colman bloom as a vulnerable, maddening queen whose moods change as fast as we can read them. No wonder Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, the two courtiers vying for her attention, can\u2019t win. They can only destroy each other, and our empathy for them, which seesaws back and forth as their statuses get wobblier.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaobq00123g5v8tuoff24@published" data-word-count="92">\n          In a Lanthimos society, the characters who behave perfectly are the most ridiculous. Our rituals themselves are bunk. He\u2019s got plenty to mock in Queen Anne\u2019s court\u2014that slo-mo duck race!\u2014but he\u2019s most interested in questioning the best way to be loved. Stone\u2019s Abigail, a scullery maid whose big blue eyes have seen a lot of misery, lavishes the queen with praise. Weisz\u2019s Lady Sarah is brutal. When the queen looks like a badger, she tells her. One loves how we want to be loved; the other delivers the love we might need.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaodc00133g5v39p7bp2n@published" data-word-count="91">\n          Lanthimos tricks us into rooting for Abigail only to about-face and side with Lady Sarah. False kindness is worse than cruel honesty. And now that Lanthimos himself is poised to be hailed as one of this generation\u2019s greatest filmmakers, I wonder if he\u2019s uncertain about that crown.<br/>Perhaps the provocateur fears that audiences will start to unquestioningly agree that he\u2019s a genius. I suspect he needs his films to put up a fight. Colman\u2019s puke-plastered Queen Anne earns our affection by being stubbornly, frustratingly, repulsively herself. He wants to do the same.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaodn00153g5vet5xpmuc@published" data-word-count="117">\n          Speaking of foreign rulers, I spent a fair chunk of this year at international film festivals, many of which have a more complex relationship with their government than, say, the Toronto International Film Festival. My most far-flung trip was to the Eurasia International Film Festival in Kazakhstan, which was recently strong-armed into switching locations from the cultural center of Almaty, an ancient city on the Silk Road, to the country\u2019s new capital, Astana, a once-empty wasteland now populated with futuristic skyscrapers, some designed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev himself. Literally\u2014there\u2019s a video of him sketching the Bayterek Tower, a 300-foot-tall structure featuring a golden egg where, at the top, visitors can touch his handprint. (It, too, is gold.)\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoek00163g5vlrl2ht3j@published" data-word-count="58">\n          The decision to trade Almaty for Astana is like if Sundance relocated to Mar-a-Lago. Not that I\u2019m complaining that some festival screenings were inside a yurt-shaped mall with rollercoasters and an indoor beach with real sand. Real sand! I buried my toes in it and drank three mojitos to soothe the headache of watching Azerbaijan\u2019s first horror flick.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaofp00173g5vgh8ga0m1@published" data-word-count="80">\n          Everything is politics, even Eurasia\u2019s opening night party, headed by Serbian director Emir Kusturica and the No Smoking Orchestra. Maybe you know Kusturica from winning the Palme d\u2019Or, twice. Maybe you know him from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696">that infamous picture in Moscow</a> where he shared a dinner table with Vladimir Putin, Michael Flynn, and Jill Stein. Maybe you have a good theory about why he was rocking out in a huge sombrero and Zapata bandoliers? I just threw up my hands and danced.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaogc00183g5vvwbmunyo@published" data-word-count="46">\n          There are two questions you ponder when you go to a lot of international film festivals. One: Why does every opening night hire a faux Charlie Chaplin? Two: What can we learn about the world from the stories their filmmakers tell, and how they tell them?\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoh700193g5vhleo1co3@published" data-word-count="114">\n          Bilge has much more authority on the topic than I do, but <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/istanbul-film-festival-turkey-censorship-1201957551/">in Istanbul</a>, I had long, wine-soaked talks with Turkish artists about what\u2019s changed in the three years since the government began enforcing a registration certificate law that functions like censorship. Political films that displease the minister of culture can\u2019t get a stamp. Without a stamp, they can\u2019t be shown\u2014not even at the festival, which had a tense standoff in 2015 over a documentary that humanized the Kurdistan guerrillas. At the last minute, the ministry canceled the screening. In response, two dozen directors canceled their own screenings, the jury refused to judge, the closing ceremony was called off, and the festival director quit.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoip001a3g5v8ufvk3yy@published" data-word-count="72">\n          This year was calmer, but what struck me about the films that squeaked through was that many of them, too, were political\u2014they\u2019d just hidden their anxieties, in time-honored fashion, in science fiction and absurdism. They told stories about towns being emptied because of an unknown stench, of immortal women who live to see every person in their life disappear, of Brechtian truth-tellers attacked for trying to keep their bosses honest.<br/>Everything <em>is</em> politics.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoj5001b3g5vl7im7ker@published" data-word-count="184">\n          At the Cairo International Film Festival, things appeared to be more liberal. One of the hot tickets was a local male director\u2019s take on abortion, a confrontational film that boasted close-ups of a fetus in a Ziploc bag and a dead giraffe. I vastly preferred Meryem Benm\u2019Barek\u2019s <strong><em>Sofia</em></strong>, an agitprop drama about a single, pregnant girl who\u2019s less scared of motherhood than of Morocco\u2019s criminalization of unmarried sex. I don\u2019t want to give away the ending, but let me just say there are even worse punishments than jail. On that topic: At our awards show, an Egyptian actress named Rania Youssef wore a dress with a see-through gauze skirt. The next day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/egypt-rania-youssef-dress.html">she was arrested for public obscenity</a> and faced up to five years in prison. <a href="https://en.vogue.me/fashion/news/charges-dropped-egyptian-actress-rania-youssef-revealing-dress/">Charges were dropped</a> after Youssef begged for forgiveness. (Other female Egyptian celebs haven\u2019t been so lucky, like the pop star\xa0<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/egyptian-pop-star-sentenced-to-2-years-for-racy-banana-eating-video/">sentenced to two years in jail</a>\xa0for suggestively eating a banana.) Going forward, all actresses on the festival\u2019s red carpet must adhere to a dress code, with Egypt\u2019s actor\u2019s union volunteering to discipline any woman who shows too much skin.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaopu001c3g5vr9zlsi31@published" data-word-count="58">\n          The best foreign language film I saw this year was <strong><em>Suleiman Mountain</em></strong>, a black dramedy about a con man and his two wives scamming their way across Kyrgyzstan in an East German camper. <em>Suleiman Mountain</em> has not gotten a real release in the states, but until it does, imagine <em>Shoplifters</em> on the road with a dash more bitters.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaopz001d3g5vimtzd6zn@published" data-word-count="91">\n          Boy, has it been a fantastic year for international cinema. <strong><em>Burning</em></strong> is terrific, though I agree with Kam that I\u2019d have traded the whole third act for five more minutes of Jong-seo Jeon\u2019s pantomimes. And <strong><em>Shoplifters</em></strong> knocked me sideways. I\u2019ll admit, I clench up when a film threatens Uncannily Wise Children, but Hirokazu Kore-eda stripped away my reservations like I was a convenience store with lousy security. I\u2019ll see <em>Roma</em>\u2019s beach scene and raise it the image of this hodgepodge family holding hands in the surf as their <em>obaasan</em> watches on.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoq1001e3g5vi8495hly@published" data-word-count="148">\n          My favorite foreign festival, by the way, was the series of documentary shorts I saw at the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/its-been-such-a-long-time-since-ive-seen-a-flower-life-in-a-syrian-refugee-camp">Azraq refugee camp in Jordan</a>, made by Syrian teenagers who\u2019d spent the past three years living in small boxes with their entire families. I was there with a dozen volunteers from Epic Magazine to help guide the kids in making their own movies. My group, five boys between 17 and 20, had a stack of still photographs that they wanted to use to make something experimental, too, though they didn\u2019t have the vocabulary\u2014or really, the film library\u2014to put their ambition into words. Someone smarter than me showed them their first clips of <em>Gates of Heaven</em> and <em>La Jet\xe9e</em>, and a lightbulb flicked on in their imagination. In a year of great movie moments from around the globe, that memory best proves the power of cinema to inspire people, wherever they are.\n        </p>, <p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cjqgvaoq4001f3g5vt4invp89@published" data-word-count="16">\n          What\u2019s that moment for you, Bilge?

[<p>Scottish actor, comedian, and musician Billy Connolly has led a remarkable career, one that\u2019s found him opening for Elton John, lending his voice to multiple Disney movies, Hobbiting with Peter Jackson, and laying waste in the <em>Boondock Saints</em> franchise. Now, the man who has brought no shortage of laughter to the world is culling tears. In an upcoming BBC Scotland documentary series on his life and career, Connolly speaks candidly about his struggle with Parkinson\u2019s disease and the knowledge that his life is \u201cslipping away\u201d from him.</p>, <p>\u201cMy life is slipping away and I can feel it, and I should, I\u2019m 75,\u201d he says in the documentary. \u201cI\u2019m near the end but it doesn\u2019t frighten me. It\u2019s an adventure, and it\u2019s quite interesting to see myself slipping away. Bits slip off and leave me. Talents leave and attributes leave. I don\u2019t have the balance I used to have; I don\u2019t have the energy I used to have; I can\u2019t hear the way I used to hear; I can\u2019t see as good as I used to. I can\u2019t remember the way I used to remember.\u201d <br/></p>, <p class="ad-label proxima"><small class="proxima">Advertisement</small></p>, <p class="ad-label-bottom"></p>, <p>He also remarks\xa0on how his condition is impacting his music, a part of his career that\u2019s been with him since he worked the Glasgow shipyards as a young man. \u201cI can\u2019t work my left hand on the banjo. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m being prepared for something, some other adventure which is over the hill. I\u2019ve got all this stuff to lose first, and then I\u2019ll be on the shadowy side of the hill, doing the next episode in the spirit world.\u201d</p>, <p>He also acknowledges that \u201cit\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d but not without embracing a bit of hope. \u201cThere\u2019s still time to go yet,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s still places to go, new friends to make, maybe new songs to write and sing and jokes to tell,\u201d he says. We sure hope so. </p>, <p><em>Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland</em> will air on BBC2 this Friday evening.

The storied site will close for about four months before it re-emerges as a <a href="https://virginhotels.com/" target="_blank">Virgin Hotel</a> in 2020.</p>, <p>Dates are still fuzzy on exactly when all of this will take place at the resort two miles east of the Strip at Harmon Avenue and Paradise Road.</p>, <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one opportunity to really enter the market,\u201d said Richard Bosworth, chief executive of JC Hospitality, which owns the property. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing that correctly and that we\u2019re not piecemealing aspects of the property: a restaurant here, a hotel room there.\u201d</p>, <p>Bosworth said keeping the hotel open during the transition would have been too disruptive for guests.</p>, <p>Virgin Hotels currently operates hotels in San Francisco and Chicago, with more planned. Renovated rooms will look like other Virgin hotels, with a design that\u2019s \u201cmodern, contemporary, light and airy, authentic [and] welcoming,\u201d Raul Leal, chief executive of Virgin Hotels, said.</p>, <p>The hotel\u2019s popular music venue, <a href="https://hardrockhotel.com/las-vegas-entertainment/1-joint-overview.php" target="_blank">the Joint</a>, will remain, but also will be upgraded and maybe renamed. Rehab, the Hard Rock\u2019s five-acre party pool area, closed last October and will be redeveloped prior to the 2020 reopening.</p>, <p>No decisions have yet been made about which restaurants and bars the new Virgin Hotel will partner with. \u201cWhen we open it, we want people to go, \u2018Oh, wow\u2019 [with] one big grand opening,\u201d Leal said.</p>, <p>The new Virgin site will compete with the city\u2019s trendier hotels \u2014 <a href="https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/" target="_blank">the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas</a>, <a href="http://www.delanolasvegas.com/en.html" target="_blank">Delano</a> and recently opened <a href="https://www.nomadlasvegas.com/en.html" target="_blank">NoMad</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cAll those do properties do a great job \u2026 but have their own identities,\u201d Leal said.</p>, <p>The Hard Rock opened in 1995 and has 1,504 rooms. The 80-foot-tall guitar that greeted arriving guests for more than two decades was dismantled in September 2017.</p>, <p>Even though the Hard Rock will shutter later this year, Bosworth is hoping to keep <a href="https://magicmikelivelasvegas.com/" target="_blank">\u201cMagic Mike Live,\u201d</a> a male revue, running during the closure. He confirmed that co-producer Channing Tatum and others are scouting a new home and that the show would be a good fit for the Virgin portfolio.</p>, <p>Vegas won\u2019t be without the Hard Rock name, however. The <a href="https://www.hardrock.com/cafes/las-vegas/" target="_blank">Hard Rock Cafe Las Vegas</a>, unrelated to the hotel, stands at a separate location at 3771 S. Las Vegas Blvd.</p>]

[<p>Idea for a new episode of HBO\u2019s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d</a></p>, <p>Marty Funkhouser has died. Larry, Cheryl, Jeff, and Susie are heartbroken at the death of their friend, and they make a shiva call. Larry and Cheryl have brought a box of rugelach for the shiva table. Throughout the shiva call, Larry watches the shiva table, and sees that no one is eating the rugelach.</p>, <p>Angry at having brought the rugelach (after all, the bakery was in Beverly Hills, quite a distance from his usual hood in Santa Monica), Larry steals the rugelach at the end of the shiva call by hiding it in his shirt.</p>, <p>On the way to his car, Larry runs into the rabbi, who tells him that anyone who takes food from a shiva home is in danger of being cursed. The rest of the episode is filled with typical Larry David mishaps. At the end of the episode, he leaves the box of rugelach on the steps of the shiva house and drives away, believing himself to be free of the curse.</p>, <p>At which point, he drives his car into the rabbi\u2019s car, and the theme music comes on.</p>, <p>I know what you\u2019re saying.</p>, <p>\u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job!\u201d</p>, <p>I felt an instant twinge of sadness in learning of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/bob-einstein-dead.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">death</a> of actor Bob Einstein at the age of 76. Bob had a plethora of screen and television roles, but the one that I will remember the most, and the reason that I mourn him, is for his role of Marty Funkhouser on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Television certainly has no shortage of Jewish characters.</p>, <p>But, \u201cCurb\u201d was uniquely Jewish.</p>, <p>Almost every character was Jewish \u2014 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_David" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Larry David;\xa0</a>his manager, Jeff Greene (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Garlin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Garlin</a>) and his wife, Susie (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Essman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Susie Essman</a>); Larry\u2019s father, played by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Berman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shelley Berman</a>; and comedian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewis_(comedian)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Richard Lewis</a>, playing himself. There were exceptions, as well \u2014 especially Larry\u2019s wife, Cheryl (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Hines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cheryl Hines).</a></p>, <p>Moreover, \u201cCurb\u201d had so many Jewish plot lines that the series practically constitutes an anthology of Jewish short fiction.</p>, <p>Among my favorites:</p>, <p>And yet, of all the Jewish characters, the one that stands out in my mind was <a href="https://www.tvovermind.com/top-five-marty-funkhouser-moments-curb-enthusiasm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marty Funkhouser</a>, played by Bob Einstein, of blessed memory.</p>, <p>Here is why.</p>, <p>While \u201cCurb\u201d is filled with Jewish characters (and the actors that play them), most of them are somewhat inactive Jews.</p>, <p>True \u2014 in one episode, Larry gets in trouble for scalping High Holy Day tickets in synagogue, which turns out to be a biting satire of the oft-discussed practice.</p>, <p>But, in most cases and in most situations, and for most of the characters, Jewish identity is unremarkable.</p>, <p>Except for Marty Funkhouser.</p>, <p>First, Marty is a mensch \u2014 perhaps the only true mensch in the series. He is the proud, supportive father of a transgender man.</p>, <p>Moreover, Marty makes no excuses for his Judaism. He embraces it. When his father died, Marty sat a traditional shiva. He grew as a Jew. He started wearing a kippah. In \u201cPalestinian Chicken,\u201d he deliberately wore the kippah to the Palestinian restaurant \u2014\xa0 because he wanted to proudly trumpet his Jewish identity, even in \u201cenemy\u201d territory.</p>, <p>Yes, \u201cCurb\u201d is a comedy. And, yes, Marty could be a little insufferable and a tad self-righteous at times.</p>, <p>But, as a Jewish character, he might have been the most affirmatively Jewish character in recent television history.</p>, <p>Bob Einstein was a great actor, and by all reports, a sweet, kind man.</p>, <p>May his family find the comfort they deserve. And may he make God laugh.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Rabbi Jeffrey K.

[<p>When you are buying something online, you expect to get that particular item when it arrives at your door. You would definitely not shop online without actually know what you are buying? It seems silly! But it turns out that buying something unseen is the latest trend on the internet. The \u201cMystery Box\u201d\u2014a website that sells prize-filled items that you exactly do not know, until you open it. It could be a fidget spinner, or you might get an iPhone or even a luxury sports car. Quite strange right? But not to the some of the popular YouTubers who have now land in controversy for promoting to what presumably is a gambling site.\xa0<a href="https://www.latestly.com/social-viral/highest-paid-youtubers-for-2018-7-year-old-ryan-tops-the-forbes-list-among-others-521036.html"><strong>Highest-Paid YouTubers for 2018: 7-Year-Old Ryan Tops the Forbes List Among Others.\xa0</strong></a> </p>, <p>The video stars urge that as a gamble worth taking. Over the past week, YouTube vloggers Jake Paul and Bryan Ricegum Le have encouraged their fans to spend their money on Mystery Brand. The owner of the site or where it is based is not clear. But as per the YouTubers, it is a site worth spending money. In the videos, Paul and Lee show themselves betting hundreds of dollars on the site for a chance to open a digital box. They only win low-value prizes initially, but towards the end of the video, they have won thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of tech and clothing such as rare pairs of sneakers or Apple AirPods. If they like the prize, they have it shipped to their house.<a href="https://www.latestly.com/social-viral/pewdiepie-defeats-t-series-as-most-popular-channel-after-youtube-deletes-spam-subcribers-545601.html"><strong>\xa0PewDiePie Defeats T-Series As Most Popular Channel After YouTube Deletes Spam Subscribers.\xa0</strong></a> </p>, <p><h2>Watch the Video of Jake Paul Promoting Mystery Box</h2> </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wO2RIEKMSg" width="100%"></iframe> </p>, <p>Both the videos show Paul and Ricegum selling back the products they do not want to the site.

Both the YouTubers have earlier reported that their subscribers are majorly young. Paul, for example, has an audience between 8 to 15 years. One of the YouTuber named Maddy Black wrote, \u201cJake, I tried this website and I completely got scammed out of a large amount of money. I am very upset to see that you would be sponsored by a company that scams people out of money.\u201d</p>]
[<p>Back in December 2017, Motherboard highlighted the work of a Redditor called deepfakes who was creating these videos, which can appear quite realistic. They\u2019ve since been banned by the likes of <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/72981-discord-shuts-down-group-shared-ai-edited-fake.html">Discord</a>, Twitter, and GIF-hosting platform Gfycat. Pornhub was supposed to have <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/73154-pornhub-bans-non-consensual-ai-edited-fake-porn.html">done the same thing</a>, but they're still easily found on site. Moreover, they\u2019ve now become more realistic while the software behind them is easier to use.</p>, <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/31/scarlett-johansson-fake-ai-generated-sex-videos-nothing-can-stop-someone-cutting-pasting-my-image/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9c3ee58a2dcb">Washington Post</a>, Johansson, who is Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actress, spoke out about the practice. The Avengers star appears in many of the videos, including one that has been viewed over 1.5 million times.</p>, <p>\u201cNothing can stop someone from cutting and pasting my image or anyone else\u2019s onto a different body and making it look as eerily realistic as desired,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is that trying to protect yourself from the Internet and its depravity is basically a lost cause [...] The Internet is a vast wormhole of darkness that eats itself.\u201d</p>, <p>While most deepfake clips use images of stars such as Maisie Williams, Taylor Swift, Aubrey Plaza, and Gal Gadot, not every victim is a celebrity. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/30/fake-porn-videos-are-being-weaponized-harass-humiliate-women-everybody-is-potential-target">Washington Post</a> story highlighted a woman in her 40s who\u2019s likeness appears in a video, though it\u2019s unclear why she was targeted.</p>, <p>While forensic tools have been <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/75893-defense-department-has-produced-first-tools-catching-deepfakes.html">developed</a> by the Defense Department for catching deepfake videos and fake news created using the same techniques, it's still a legal grey area. Unlike <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/66843-celebgate-hacker-sentenced-18-months-federal-prison.html">The Fappening</a>, which saw explicit photos of celebs including Johansson posted online, no personal data is stolen when creating the clips.

[<p><a href="/"><img src="/images/logo.png"/></a></p>, <p class="bold mastDate">Friday, Jan 04, 2019 | Last Update : 06:30 AM IST</p>, <p>Sara Ali Khan has firmly based her feet in Bollywood with two back-to-back film releases. Her acting skills have the audiences\u2019 approval though she feels she still has a long way to go, with a lot more to prove. She says, \u201cThe only thing I needed was to see myself on screen first. I understand that the opinions of my parents, friends, seniors, and audiences matter a lot. Seeing the appreciation, I feel a duty now,\u201d she says.\xa0</p>, <p>The 25-year-old further shares, \u201cYour battles keep changing as there are new challenges. Now the challenge is not searching for acceptance. I have done Kedarnath and Simmba and I\u2019ve worked hard, done my best and also received 80 per cent of praise. 20 per cent is good karma and they know I am a sweet person and they will not write me off.\u201d</p>, <p style="border:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;padding:0px;">\xa0</p>, <p>For a newcomer, maneuvering different genres and films in Bollywood can be perplexing, but Sara wants to challenge herself as an actor and wants directors to give her a chance.\xa0</p>, <p>Now that she has arrived and is here to stay, brand endorsements will soon come knocking at her door. Her mom has been the guiding light in her life and even accompanies her to film narrations. But Sara has the last word before signing on the dotted line. Her resemblance to a young Amrita Singh has been talked about multiple times, but she will only really take a compliment when she can match her mothers acting skills, \u201cI took a picture of me in purple lipstick and there was a picture of my mom thirty years ago in purple lipstick. It\u2019s more of DNA and chance. I felt \u2018wow we are doing the same thing\u2019\u2026. but I don\u2019t know about acting. She is an extremely fine actor and it will take me a long time to be compared to her,\u201d she says.</p>, <p>Her grandmother, the veteran actress Sharmila Tagore also dotes on her granddaughter and has said repeatedly how proud she is of her achievements. Sara has now become the binding thread between both the families, \u201cDadi is getting a lot of messages from people and she forwards those messages to my mom which is a big thing. There\u2019s no happiness greater than this feeling,\u201d she graciously shares.</p>, <p>Sara would love to do a third film, but she has not read any scripts yet. While holidays are also not on the cards, Sara knows where she\u2019s headed for her next destination, but not without her mother. \u201cLast holiday I went for a holiday without my mother. But this time if things work for us\u2026I will take her along with me. This time we will go to Ajmer Sharif and we will also pay a visit to the Golden Temple.\u201d</p>, <p></p>]

[<p><em>90 Day Fiance</em> star Ashley Martson is FINALLY clearing up all the confusion about why she and husband Jay Smith had three different weddings, including one in Jamaica, one in Las Vegas, and the other in Pennsylvania.</p>, <p>To get you all caught up, there were <a href="https://starcasm.net/90-day-fiance-jay-ashley-wedding-photos-leak-jamaica/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">photos leaked in early December</a> of what appeared to be Ashley and Jay\u2019s formal wedding ceremony in Jamaica. Jay would later explain that this was a commitment ceremony from 2017 so that his friends and family in Jamaica could attend.</p>, <p>Then, on the show, we see Ashley and Jay getting married in Las Vegas in a kitschy Elvis-themed ceremony. However, we could find no record of Jay and Ashley getting married in or near Las Vegas. Plus, Ashley\u2019s (former?) best friend Natalie later shared photos of herself in Las Vegas for the wedding, and she stated on Instagram that Ashley and Jay were already married. (<a href="https://starcasm.net/90-day-fiance-jay-ashley-still-together-fake/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You can click here for a full recap of all the fishiness surrounding Ashleyy and Jay\u2019s story line this season.</a>)</p>, <p>OK Ashley, take it away\u2026</p>, <p>\u201cI know there are some rumors,\u201d Ashley began an Instagram post from moments ago, \u201cso I spoke with TLC they would like me to clarify: We scheduled our original wedding on the 88th day after Jay arrived to America. Due to canceling our original wedding plans so last minute (as you saw on the show during the wedding registry incident) and having my kids that weekend, we could not go to Vegas before the 90 days were up. Jay and I went to City Hall in Harrisburg, PA, said our vows, then flew out to Vegas for an actual ceremony a week later.\u201d</p>, <p>She continues: \u201cThis is why no one can find a public certificate in the Vegas records. I hope this gives you all some clarification! Please don\u2019t mind my kids juice box spill on the certificate! \U0001f926\U0001f3fc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #momlife #married #90dayfiance #tlc #receipts\u201d</p>, <p><a href="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certifcate.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-404021" height="359" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" src="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certifcate.jpg?ggnoads" srcset="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certifcate.jpg 561w, https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certifcate-490x359.jpg 490w" title="90 Day Fiance Ashley and Jay marriage certifcate" width="490"/></a><br/>\n<a href="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certificate_final.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-404023" height="489" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" src="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certificate_final.jpg" srcset="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certificate_final.jpg 600w, https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certificate_final-490x489.jpg 490w, https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/90_Day_Fiance_Ashley_Jay_marriage_certificate_final-144x144.jpg 144w" title="90 Day Fiance Ashley Jay marriage certificate final" width="490"/></a></p>, <p>On the marriage certificate, you can see that Jay (real name Conroy) and Ashley were officially married in Upper Allen Township, Pennsylvania on May 16, 2018.

And I really want to thank Ashley as well as TLC for sharing this information because her and Jay\u2019s story was getting so muddy as far as what was real and what was scripted that I was finding it hard to enjoy watching them on the show. This information remedies that a bit, although I would have much preferred that they were just honest from the get go \u2014 or at least dropped the \u201csurprise\u201d about the real wedding after the Las Vegas wedding.

Every guy actor my age had gone up for it. I\u2019ve been lucky, but a lot of the bigger Hollywood movies like <em>Spider-Man</em>, things like that, I didn\u2019t get. So, for <em>Beautiful Boy</em>, I did a lot of research and read about drugs, and I brought the books to my first meeting with the director. I could see in his eyes that he was thinking, This kid is nuts. But I felt this movie\u2014the subject of drug addiction\u2014was so important. I wanted to make an anti-glorification-of-drugs movie. And I think we did.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>On meeting Nic Sheff, who he plays in the film:</strong> \u201cYes. I met him a week before we started shooting. And there was nothing about Nic that fit my stereotype of an addict. That was the learning grace of this movie: Nic is alive and well, but the reality is, it\u2019s a day at a time. You never really beat it.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>On losing weight for the role:</strong> \u201cMy mom was worried! I lost 18 pounds. First, I\u2019m in a movie where I was having sex with a peach, and then it was like, \u2018I got another movie!\u2019 She said, \u2018Great!\u2019 And then I had to tell her what it was about.\u201d</p>, <p>For more from <strong>Timothee</strong>, visit <a class="external" href="https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/best-performances-nicole-kidman-claire-foy-rami-malek" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Outgoing Links', '/outgoing/https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/best-performances-nicole-kidman-claire-foy-rami-malek')" rel="external" target="_blank">WMagazine.com</a>.</p>, <p>Follow Just Jared Jr. on Twitter!</p>, <p>Become a Fan on Facebook!</p>]

At the hearing, the musician's attorney Gideon Cammerman QC stated "This is made up for the purpose of improving the chance of success in a civil action in the United States for $1million."</p>, <p>At least four witnesses are expected to fly across the pond when the trial officially begins on Thursday (Jan. 3).</p>, <p>Last July, a video of the alleged adult leaked online, which shows Bari (real name\xa0Jabari Shelton) reportedly trying to force a woman to perform oral sex on him. When she refused and tried to get away, he smacks her on the bottom.</p>, <p>"I was forced into bed by Bari and his crew and Bari got upset because I refused to engage in any sexual acts," the woman allegedly in the video tweeted after it began to go viral. The video has since been deleted, and Bari has denied the allegations.</p>, <p><strong>READ MORE:\xa0<a href="https://www.vibe.com/2017/08/nike-ends-asap-bari-partnership-sexual-assault-allegations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nike Ends Relationship With A$AP Bari Following Sexual Assault Allegations</a></strong></p>, <p>Latin artists dominated in 2018, and all of their hard work is starting to show some real results. According to a new-year report from data, music consumption company BuzzAngle, Latin music consumption is now more popular than that of country music.</p>, <p>According to the report, Latin music accounted for 9.4 percent of all album listening in the United States in 2018. It was reportedly measured by combining the physical and digital sales, song downloads, and on-demand streams. The growth in music consumption surpassed country music consumption, which only accounted for 8.7 percent of all album consumption in the U.S.</p>, <p>The prior year, country music accounted for 8.1 percent of album-listening, while Latin music clocked in at 7.5 percent.</p>, <p>Individual song-listening has also increased in popularity. In the past year, fans have increased their consumption from 9.5 percent to 10.8 percent. Country music is still behind at 7.8 percent. Latin artist video views have also increased to 24.3 percent from 21.9 percent.</p>, <p>While country music still dominates on the radio, the Latin music genre is reportedly closing in on R&amp;B and rock, which are tallied at 11.2 percent and 11.7 percent respectively.</p>, <p>The music industry better look out because Latin music is bound to keep climbing the ladder in the new year.</p>, <p>Rae Sremmurd's Slim Jxmmi was reportedly involved in a street brawl in New Zealand on Thursday (Jan. 3) that ended with one person being stabbed, TMZ reports.</p>, <p>The incident reportedly occurred while Slim Jxmmi was walking through the streets of New Zealand's downtown Auckland. Footage obtained by the celebrity site shows the 26-year-old getting physical with several other people as a man \u2013 who is believe to be the rapper's bodyguard \u2013 throws punches in his defense.</p>, <p>The altercation allegedly ensued after someone allegedly attempted to record Slim Jxmmi and friends while they were walking. Witnesses on the scene alleged they saw a broken bottle being used as a weapon, which may have ultimately led to the stabbing. One individual was reportedly taken to the Auckland City Hospital to be treated for stab wounds.</p>, <p>Rae Sremmurd's other member, Swae Lee, was not present at the time. While neither the video nor witnesses have indicated that Slim Jxmmi committed the stabbing, it's unclear if local law enforcement are investigating him at this time.</p>, <p>Rae Sremmurd is currently visiting New Zealand and Australia as part of a handful of tour dates.</p>, <p>Check out the footage of the violent altercation in the video above.</p>, <p>A $100,000 reward is now available for anyone who has credible information, which will lead to the arrest of the white man who shot and killed 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes.</p>, <p>"We want to make sure that we get the right person as quickly as possible,"\xa0Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said during a press conference.</p>, <p>The unprovoked attack sent shockwaves through the\xa0Harris County community, leaving many\xa0wanting justice for Jazmine and her surviving family members. Police are hoping the sketched description offered by Jazmine's sisters will help capture the killer.\xa0Until then, all law enforcement have to work with is a\xa0grainy\xa0image of the getaway vehicle, a red extended cab pick-up truck.</p>, <p>Along with the reward money, a Go Fund Me account has been established to assist with Jazmine's funeral.

The show\u2019s optimistic visions of revitalization, achieved through simple efforts toward domestic order, is a decent hangover sedative in itself. Our host is the author of the best-selling self-help guide \u201c<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1607747308/?tag=thneyo0f-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing</a>.\u201d In each of the season\u2019s eight episodes, Kondo materializes in a home to bless it with her practical philosophy of purging junk. \u201cI love a mess,\u201d she says. She likes a challenge, that is. Each episode of this housekeeping procedural preaches the pleasures of her process. I found it impossible to binge the show, largely because it kept jolting me to the back of the closet in the kids\u2019 room, where I meditated on disused Hot Wheels race tracks.</p>, <p>The introduction finds the petite Kondo approaching an overstuffed closet, daintily hopping to reach a high shelf, and cutely failing. There is perhaps a smidgen of Orientalism in the series\u2019s framing of its Japanese star as a sprite who flutters efficiently across a nonspecific U.S.A., gracing its chaotic households with wisdom. Perhaps she\u2019s not an Other, just otherworldly, in the manner of a fairy godmother or enchanted nanny. Either way, spirituality is essential to her method, and \u201cmagic\u201d is central to its meaning; she knows that the unloved stuff in the garage is weighing down the soul. The word \u201ctidying,\u201d with its implication of light dusting and fluffing sofa cushions, is insufficient to the physical task Kondo proposes, which may involve gathering an entire wardrobe of clothing, accumulated over decades, into a linebacker-size pile. This is a vision of the organizational consultant as a freelance exorcist. In its formulation of these tasks not as tedious chores but as energizing exercises, it is in line with current discourse on self-care, in which moisturizing lotions are sacramental ointments.</p>, <p>A typical episode of \u201cTidying Up,\u201d which grafts Kondo\u2019s methodology onto a familiar makeover-show format, does not offer much in the way of struggle or conflict. Kondo\u2019s mere presence initiates self-directed journeys, and her thorough pleasantness closes off the possibility of \u201cSupernanny\u201d-type scoldings. The sensibility of the production accidentally casts complicated problems as jokes. A black-and-white sequence depicting the frustration of a guy who despairs that his toddlers are \u201cgetting the worst of me\u201d finds him venting at his wife. \u201cThere are seven pillows on this bed,\u201d he fumes, \u201cand <em class="">those aren\u2019t even decorative pillows</em>.\u201d The soundtrack simpers along with the generic jangling guitar and mawkish plinking piano of any given HGTV program, but it flips to something chiming and ethereal when Kondo appears alone, in a vaguely celestial setting, addressing the viewer directly in instructional interludes.</p>, <p>Kondo, of course, has a million-dollar catchphrase: initiates must cast out items that fail to \u201cspark joy.\u201d (According to this principle, I chucked my household\u2019s copy of \u201cLife-Changing Magic\u201d after a half hour\u2019s perusal of its welcome advice.) \u201cWhen you touch the item that sparks joy for you, you feel <em class="">chi-i-ing</em>\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. all of yourself rising,\u201d Kondo says, in the first episode. When she issues that sound effect\u2014a noise onomatopoeic of crystalline cheer\u2014her voice and smile gleam like a glass in a dish-detergent ad. It\u2019s unspeakably charming. But the laws of brand extension decree that she must keep renewing and reinterpreting the phrase. The buzzword becomes a nagging drone, and related themes are repeated until they begin to sound like nonsense. Knowing that sentimental attachments can be shackles, Kondo directs her clients to fill their hearts with gratitude for items that have outlived their utility. (An expired packet of gravy mix cannot bear this degree of reverence, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.) The show is decent company if you\u2019re just sitting there folding the laundry, and you will be folding it with unprecedented panache\u2014conveying \u201clove to your clothes from the palms of your hands,\u201d Kondo says\u2014if you follow her teachings. \u201cTidying Up\u201d is mindless television on the topic of mindful domesticity.</p>, <p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Troy Patterson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.</p>, <p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Sign up for the <i>New Yorker</i> Recommends newsletter and get expert recommendations every week from the worlds of film, literature, and music.</p>, <p class="Byline__by___37lv8">By <a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/david-sedaris" rel="author" title="David Sedaris">David Sedaris</a></p>, <p class="Byline__by___37lv8">By <a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/nathan-heller" rel="author" title="Nathan Heller">Nathan Heller</a></p>, <p class="Byline__by___37lv8">By <a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/john-cassidy" rel="author" title="John Cassidy">John Cassidy</a></p>, <p class="Byline__by___37lv8">By <a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/nicholas-lemann" rel="author" title="Nicholas Lemann">Nicholas Lemann</a></p>, <p class="Byline__by___37lv8">By <a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/amanda-petrusich" rel="author" title="Amanda Petrusich">Amanda Petrusich</a></p>, <p class="Video__title___3QAw2">The Blessings of Aging</p>, <p class="Video__description___1pPO8">Residents of a retirement community talk about the many upsides of getting older.</p>, <p class="RecirculationRecommendedStories__byline___eynVy">By\xa0<a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/troy-patterson" rel="author" title="Troy Patterson">Troy Patterson</a></p>, <p class="RecirculationRecommendedStories__byline___eynVy">By\xa0<a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/troy-patterson" rel="author" title="Troy Patterson">Troy Patterson</a></p>, <p class="RecirculationRecommendedStories__byline___eynVy">By\xa0<a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/david-sedaris" rel="author" title="David Sedaris">David Sedaris</a></p>, <p class="RecirculationRecommendedStories__byline___eynVy">By\xa0<a class="Link__link___3dWao " href="/contributors/nathan-heller" rel="author" title="Nathan Heller">Nathan Heller</a></p>]

With decades of experience in the industry, Michael Kureth envisioned a game show that would introduce the masses to what actually happens in the interview conference rooms of top tech companies. <br/> <br/> Three contestants will have the chance to impress the judges, all tech-industry insiders, for a chance to show off their technical prowess both on the whiteboard and in a timed coding event. With a set of tokens, players will be able to change the outcome of their own whiteboard session while hindering that of their colleagues. <br/> <br/> Filmed in Los Angeles in front of a live audience of industry professionals, contestants compete for prizes and recognition. Being crowned champion labels one contestant as the true "rockstar" above all in an over saturated tech industry where everyone is claiming to be a software engineer. <br/> <br/> To guarantee seating for professionals and avoid interruptions, we kindly ask that no recruiters attend the event. <br/> <br/> IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9470306/ <br/> Site: http://WhiteboardChallenge.com <br/> <br/> <div> Contact <br/> Michael Kureth <br/> ***@whiteboardchallenge.com <br/> <br/> Photo: <br/> https://www.prlog.org/12746823/1 </div> <div></div><p>MENAFN0301201900703076ID1097920885</p><!--MENAFN0301201900703076ID1097920885--></p>, <p>MENAFN0301201900703076ID1097920885</p>, <p></p>, <p>Tags</p>, <p>Comments</p>, <p>Category</p>, <p>Date</p>, <p class="footer-info">\n<div class="radio">\n<label><input checked="" name="question" type="radio" value="0"/> Daily English </label>\n</div>\n<div class="radio">\n<label><input name="question" type="radio" value="1"/> Daily Arabic </label>\n</div>\n<div class="radio">\n<label><input name="question" type="radio" value="2"/> All </label>\n</div>\n</p>, <p class="footer-logo"><img alt="logo" src="/includes/img/logo.jpg"/></p>, <p class="footer-info" style="font:15px;">World and Middle East business and financial news, Stocks, Currencies, Market Data, Research, Weather and other data.</p>, <p style="display:table-row;">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Contact Us\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span style="font-size:16px;color:White;font-weight:bold;padding-left: 5px;"><a href="https://menafn.com/mf_contact.aspx?src=Contact_Gen"> Click here </a></span>\n</p>, <p>\n<span>Tel:</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+962 6 5690450\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>, <p class="copyright">\r\n                        Copyright \xa9 2000 <a href="https://menafn.com">MENAFN.</a> All rights reserved.</p>, <p class="pull-right">\r\n                        Design &amp; Devleopment by\xa0<a href="https://menafn.com/">MENAFN</a></p>]

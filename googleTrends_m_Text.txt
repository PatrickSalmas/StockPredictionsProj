The Food and Drug Administration announced Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. is voluntarily recalling 80 lots of Amlodipine Valsartan Tablets, Valsartan HCTZ Tablets, and Valsartan Tablets.</p>, <p>The impurity involves a chemical called N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), which the FDA describes as a "substance that occurs naturally in certain foods, drinking water, air pollution, and industrial processes, and has been classified as a probable human carcinogen."</p>, <p>To date, the company says it has not received any reports of patients suffering adverse effects related to the recall.</p>, <p>A full list of the recalled products is posted on the FDA's website. Products can be identified by checking the product name, manufacturer details, and batch or lot number on the pill bottles. Expiration dates range from May 2019 to March 2021.</p>, <p>The FDA is advising patients prescribed these medications to continue to take them, as the health risks may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment. However, patients should consult with their pharmacist or physician who can advise them on alternative treatments.</p>, <p>Last month, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited issued a voluntary recall of two lots of Losartan potassium tablets over similar concerns surrounding trace amounts of NDEA.

These illnesses are measles, pneumococcal infections, and others, which are easily avoidable by the quality and free vaccines in Georgia,\u201d Zoidze said.\xa0</p>, <p>He explained that 10 types of vaccination were previously of a recommendation kind, now it is said in the law that it is mandatory to take children to vaccination.</p>, <p>The National Calendar of Vaccination includes 10 vaccines in Georgia. Children are vaccinated against the following infections: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, rubella, mumps, poliomyelitis, rotavirus infections, etc. These diseases can cause very severe complications if children are not vaccinated on time.\xa0</p>, <p>Around 14 million people die from infectious diseases every year in the world.

[<p><p>Large differences in radiation doses used for CT scans are mainly due to how the scanners are used by medical staff rather than differences in the patients scanned or machines used, a study has found.</p>\n<p>Setting more consistent dose standards should therefore be possible and will ensure that patients are not exposed to unnecessary radiation risks, according to the study published in The BMJ.</p>\n<p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning creates detailed pictures of areas inside the body to help diagnose a range of conditions, said researchers, including those from the University of California, San Francisco in the US.</p>\n<p>However, CT radiation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, so it is important to minimise exposure and reduce unnecessary

[<p>A new neurostimulator developed by engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, can listen to and stimulate electric current in the brain at the same time, potentially delivering fine-tuned treatments to patients with diseases like epilepsy and Parkinson's.</p>, <p>The device, named the WAND, works like a "pacemaker for the brain," monitoring the brain's electrical activity and delivering electrical stimulation if it detects something amiss.</p>, <p>These devices can be extremely effective at preventing debilitating tremors or seizures in patients with a variety of neurological conditions. But the electrical signatures that precede a seizure or tremor can be extremely subtle, and the frequency and strength of electrical stimulation required to prevent them is equally touchy. It can take years of small adjustments by doctors before the devices provide optimal treatment.</p>, <p>WAND, which stands for wireless artifact-free neuromodulation device, is both wireless and autonomous, meaning that once it learns to recognize the signs of tremor or seizure, it can adjust the stimulation parameters on its own to prevent the unwanted movements. Because it is closed-loop\u2014meaning it can stimulate and record simultaneously\u2014it can adjust these parameters in real-time.</p>, <p>"The process of finding the right therapy for a patient is extremely costly and can take years. Significant reduction in both cost and duration can potentially lead to greatly improved outcomes and accessibility," said Rikky Muller,\xa0assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at Berkeley. "We want to enable the device to figure out what is the best way to stimulate for a given patient to give the best outcomes. And you can only do that by listening and recording the neural signatures."</p>, <p>WAND can record electrical activity over 128 channels, or from 128 points in the brain, compared to eight channels in other closed-loop systems.</p>, <p>To demonstrate the device, the team used WAND to recognize and delay specific arm movements in rhesus macaques. The device is described in a study that appeared in\xa0<em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>, <p>Simultaneously stimulating and recording electrical signals in the brain is much like trying to see small ripples in a pond while also splashing your feet\u2014the electrical signals from the brain are overwhelmed by the large pulses of electricity delivered by the stimulation.</p>, <p>Currently, deep brain stimulators either stop recording while delivering the electrical stimulation, or record at a different part of the brain from where the stimulation is applied\u2014essentially measuring the small ripples at a different point in the pond from the splashing.</p>, <p>"In order to deliver closed-loop stimulation-based therapies, which is a big goal for people treating Parkinson's and epilepsy and a variety of neurological disorders, it is very important to both perform neural recordings and stimulation simultaneously, which currently no single commercial device does," said\xa0Samantha Santacruz, former UC Berkeley postdoctoral associate who is now an assistant professor at the University of Texas in Austin.</p>, <p>Researchers at Cortera Neurotechnologies, Inc., led by Muller, designed the WAND custom integrated circuits that can record the full signal from both the subtle brain waves and the strong electrical pulses. This chip design allows WAND to subtract the signal from the electrical pulses, resulting in a clean signal from the brain waves.</p>, <p>Existing devices are tuned to record signals only from the smaller brain waves and are overwhelmed by the large stimulation pulses, making this type of signal reconstruction impossible.</p>, <p>"Because we can actually stimulate and record in the same brain region, we know exactly what is happening when we are providing a therapy," Muller said.</p>, <p>In collaboration with the lab of Jan Rabaey, an electrical engineering and computer science professor, the team built a platform device with wireless and closed-loop computational capabilities that can be programmed for use in a variety of research and clinical applications.</p>, <p>In experiments lead by Santacruz while a postdoc at UC Berkeley, and by Jose Carmena, an electrical engineering and computer science professor, subjects were taught to use a joystick to move a cursor to a specific location.</p>, <p>After a training period, the WAND device was capable of detecting the neural signatures that arose as the subjects prepared to perform the motion, and then deliver electrical stimulation that delayed the motion.</p>, <p>"While delaying reaction time is something that has been demonstrated before, this is, to our knowledge, the first time that it has been demonstrated in a closed-loop system based on a neurological recording only," Muller said. "In the future we aim to incorporate learning into our closed-loop platform to build intelligent devices that can figure out how to best treat you, and remove the doctor from having to constantly intervene in this process."</p>, <p><a href="http://labequip.disqus.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laboratoryequipment.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F01%2Fpacemaker-brain-could-offer-new-treatment">View the discussion thread.</a></p>, <p class="small">Note: If you are using a browser that is not listed here, please do a quick internet search on how to block cookies and tracking for your specific browser.</p>, <p>This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best user experience.

[<p><a href="https://newatlas.com/author/michael-irving/" rel="author">Michael Irving</a></p>, <p><span>Researchers at the University of Michigan have found a\xa0molecule that may be a potential target in new treatments to slow aging</span><span class="caption__credit">(Credit: <span><a href="https://depositphotos.com/63208141/stock-photo-neuron-energy.html" rel="nofollow">ktsdesign/Depositphotos</a></span>)</span></p>, <p>Although we generally accept aging as a necessary evil, nobody would pass up the chance to slow it down. Now researchers from the University of Michigan may have found a way to do just that \u2013 in worms at least. The team has identified a molecule in neurons that, when blocked, improves motor function in older worms and increases their lifespan and general health. Better yet, similar pathways might be at work inside humans too.</p>, <p>The worms in question belong to a species known as <em class="redactor-inline-converted">C. elegans</em>, and they're often used as models of aging and health. That's because these little critters, barely one millimeter in length, age in a way very similar to other animals, including humans, but do so over a very short, easily-monitored lifespan of about three weeks. In the past, they've been used to study the role of the <a href="https://newatlas.com/worm-axis-aging-mechanism/53618/" target="_blank">brain and gut in aging</a>, examine the genetic reasons we haven't <a href="https://newatlas.com/evolution-immortality-genes/51392/" target="_blank">evolved immortality</a>, and delve into what kind of <a href="https://newatlas.com/anti-aging-drug-cocktail-lifespan-extension/56902/" target="_blank">drug cocktails</a> could extend lifespan.</p>, <p>"We previously observed that as worms age, they gradually lose physiological functions," says Shawn Xu, senior author of the new study. "Sometime around the middle of their adulthood, their motor function begins to decline. But what causes that decline?"</p>, <p>To investigate, the researchers examined the junctions where motor neurons and muscle tissue connect in the worms. There, they identified a molecule known as slowpoke potassium channel family member 1 (SLO-1) regulates those communications, reducing the neurons' activity and over time, decreasing motor function.</p>, <p>The team then examined the effects of blocking SLO-1. In some animals they used genetic tools to do the job, and in another group they tried a drug called paxilline. Regardless of the method used, the treated worms were found to have improved motor function later in life, and enjoyed longer lifespans than the control group.</p>, <p>"It's not necessarily ideal to have a longer lifespan without improvements in health or strength," says Xu. "But we found that the interventions improved both parameters \u2014 these worms are healthier and they live longer."</p>, <p>Interestingly, it made a difference <em>when</em> in the worms' lives the team gave them the treatment. The most positive effects were seen when the worms were treated in their middle age. When SLO-1 was blocked in young worms, it didn't increase their lifespan at all and instead, actually deteriorated their motor function.</p>, <p>The potential good news is that SLO-1 is present in other animals too, so in the future the researchers plan to conduct similar experiments in other organisms to see if the results can be replicated. </p>, <p>The research was published in the journal <em class="redactor-inline-converted"><a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau5041?rss=1" target="_blank">Science Advances</a></em>.</p>, <p>Source: <a href="https://news.umich.edu/living-a-stronger-and-longer-life-what-u-m-scientists-are-learning-from-worms/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> </p>, <p>\n<span>Researchers at the University of Michigan have found a\xa0molecule that may be a potential target in new treatments to slow aging</span>\n<span class="caption__credit">(Credit: &lt;a href="https://depositphotos.com/63208141/stock-photo-neuron-energy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;ktsdesign/Depositphotos&lt;/a&gt;)</span>\n</p>, <p><span>Want a cleaner, faster loading and ad free reading experience? </span><br class="u-show-desktop-only"/><span>Try New Atlas Plus. </span><a href="https://secure.newatlas.com/register/payment/">Learn more</a></p>, <p class="h2 article-tags__title">Tags</p>, <p class="h2">Share this article</p>, <p class="note_normal">See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning</p>, <p id="modal_result"></p>, <p>See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning</p>, <p class="footer__copyright">Copyright \xa9 Gizmag Pty Ltd 2019</p>]
[<p>THURSDAY, Jan. 3, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Flu spreads like wildfire in confined spaces -- and that includes  subways, a new British study finds.</p>, <p>The longer your ride and the more stations you encounter during your daily commute, the higher your odds of getting sick, the researchers found. </p>, <p>University of Bristol researcher Lara Gosce and colleagues found fewer cases of flu in places where people did not rely as much on public transportation or had shorter commutes with fewer stops. </p>, <p>For example, infection rates among people in one town who had to change subway lines at a crowded station were nearly triple those of commuters from a nearby town who mostly took direct trains, the findings showed.</p>, <p>Gosce said public health officials should use the findings to understand the role public transportation and major events can play in spreading disease and to urge people to avoid crowds during disease epidemics.</p>, <p>The report was published recently in the journal <i>Environmental Health</i>.</p>, <p><b>More information</b></p>, <p>For more about flu, visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/symptoms.htm" target="_blank"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>, <p class="source">SOURCE: University of Bristol, news release, December 2018</p>, <p class="author">-- <a href="http://www.healthday.com/healthday-editors-reporters.html#22" target="_blank"><span itemprop="author"> Steven Reinberg</span></a></p>, <p class="pubdate">Last Updated: <time datetime="Jan 3, 2019" itemprop="dateModified">Jan 3, 2019</time></p>, <p class="copyright">Copyright \xa9 2019 <a href="http://www.healthday.com/" target="_blank">HealthDay</a>.

While one in 10 boys do not use social media at all, only 4% of girls said the same.</p>, <p>\u201cThe link between social media use and depressive symptoms was stronger for girls compared with boys. For girls, greater daily hours of social media use corresponded to a stepwise increase in depressive symptoms,\u201d explained Kelly.</p>, <p>For example, while 7.5% of 14-year-old girls and 4.3% of 14-year-old boys have been the victim of online harassment, 35.6% of girls who are depressed have experienced that \u2013 double the 17.4% of boys who have done so. Among teenagers who had perpetrated online bullying, 32.8% of girls and 7.9% of boys were depressed.</p>, <p>That pattern of stark gender differences was repeated when young people were quizzed about other key aspects of their feelings and behaviour, Kelly\u2019s team found.</p>, <p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media">Social media</a> is also closely associated with poor sleeping habits, especially among 14-year-olds showing clinical signs of depression. While just 5.4% of girls and 2.7% of boys overall said they slept for seven hours or less, 48.4% of girls with low mood and 19.8% of such boys said the same. Half of depressed girls and a quarter of depressed boys said that they suffer from disrupted sleep \u201cmost of the time\u201d.</p>, <p>The authors say the sleep disruption is due to young people staying up late to use social media and being woken up by alerts coming in to their phones beside their beds. Their findings are published on Friday in EClinicalMedicine, a journal published by the Lancet.</p>, <p>\u201cInevitably there is the chicken and egg question, as to whether more dissatisfied children, who to begin with are less pleased with their body shape and have fewer friends then spend more time on social media. Nonetheless, it is likely that excessive use of social media does lead to poorer confidence and mental health,\u201d said Prof Stephen Scott, the director of the national academy for parenting research at the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at King\u2019s College London.</p>, <p>Prof Sir Simon Wessely, an ex-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the researchers \u201cstill cannot definitely say that social media usage causes poor mental health, although the evidence is starting to point in that direction\u201d.</p>, <p>Government ministers and Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, have called on social media companies to do much more to limit the amount of time young people spend using their platforms. Stevens has suggested taxing companies to help the NHS cover the costs of treating soaring numbers of under-18s suffering problems such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and psychosis, which Theresa May has made a personal priority.</p>, <p>Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, has warned that even some children as young as nine \u201care becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation that makes them happy, and many are increasingly anxious about their online image and \u2018keeping up appearances\u2019.</p>, <p>\u201cTheir use of platforms like Instagram and Snapchat can also undermine children\u2019s view of themselves by making them feel inferior to the people they follow,\u201d she added.</p>, <p>Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said social media firms should be forced to adopt a new duty of care to protect young users.</p>, <p>But Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist who specialises in teenagers\u2019 mental wellbeing, cautioned against heaping too much blame on social media for the huge recent rise in mental ill-health among under-18s. \u201cDepression and all mental ill-health conditions arise due to a range of complex factors, usually a biological, psychological and social mix,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cThese findings add to the growing evidence base and show precisely why the concerns that we and others have raised about the potential harmful links between social media and young people\u2019s mental health need to be taken seriously.</p>, <p>\u201cEveryone must start taking responsibility, including social media giants, to help young people develop and maintain good mental health, rather than let problems build up to the point that they need specialist help from the NHS.\u201d</p>, <p>Shannon McLaughlin, 18, from Blackburn, has opened up about how social media has harmed her mental health.</p>, <p>\u201cSince being diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my early teens, my mental health has definitely been affected by social media. The sad truth is that people mostly share the positive things about life on social media, without showing the negatives. This really affected me when I was struggling with my mental health and would constantly scroll through Facebook and Instagram. Seeing that everyone was happy and enjoying life made me feel so much worse. In fact, it made me feel like I was doing something wrong. Why was I feeling so different to everyone else?</p>, <p>\u201cIt not only affected how I was feeling about myself mentally, but also physically. I was constantly confronted by women with unattainably skinny bodies who were praised for the way they looked. Even though I was a size 10, it really affected the way I looked at my own body. This was only made worse by the abundance of diet fixes and skinny culture promoted by \u2018influencers\u2019, whose posts are broadcast to thousands of people every day.\u201d</p>, <p>McLaughlin does volunteer work, including putting on blind football events. She is travelling to Germany on Friday to work on one such programme and, while there, will research the provision of services for blind people in that country, as well as how those same services can possibly be improved in the UK.</p>, <p>About two years ago, she began volunteering with the National Citizen Service. \u201cWhen I was 16, I decided it was important for me to invest time in new friends and people that made me feel positive in real life. That\u2019s when I decided to go on National Citizen Service. NCS was life-changing for me. It made me connect with real people, build my confidence and feel less alone. It\u2019s so important for young people to make real connections without hiding behind a text message or a happy social media post.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to forget the importance of real connections when we constantly have hundreds of people that we\u2019re trying to impress at our fingertips. I think it\u2019s important for young people to look up from their phones and focus more on the world around them, and the amazing connections that they can make there.\u201d</p>]

[<p>Researchers restores youthfulness in mice</p>, <p>Scientists claim to have identified a way to clear away old, damaged cells and restore youthful characteristics in mice -- paving the way for anti-ageing therapies and treatments of diseases linked to old age.</p>, <p>The research from Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel suggests that the dream of keep our bodies young, healthy and energetic, even as we attain the wisdom of our years could be at least partly obtainable in the future.</p>, <p>The research, published in Nature Communications, began with an investigation into the way that the immune system is involved in a crucial activity: clearing away old, senescent cells that spell trouble for the body when they hang around.</p>, <p>Senescent cells\u2014not completely dead but suffering loss of function or irreparable damage\u2014have been implicated in diseases of ageing by promoting inflammation.</p>, <p>The researchers used mice in which a crucial gene for this immune activity was missing. At two years\u2014which is an elderly age for mice -- the bodies had a greater accumulation of senescent cells compared with the those in which the gene for removing these cells was intact.</p>, <p>The mice missing the gene suffered from chronic inflammation, and various functions in their bodies appeared to be diminished. They also looked older\u2014and died earlier\u2014than their counterparts.</p>, <p>The researchers gave the mice a drug that inhibits the function of certain proteins that help the ageing cells survive in their senescent state, to see if this would contribute to the removal of these cells from the body.</p>, <p>The drugs were administered to mice whose ageing was a result of the malfunctions the group had uncovered in the immune system as well as those suffering premature ageing from a different genetic error.</p>, <p>The treated mice responded exceptionally well to the drug: Their blood tests and activity tests showed improvement, and their tissues appeared to be much closer to those of young mice.</p>, <p>The scientists counted senescent cells, finding many fewer of them remaining in the treated mice's bodies; and when they looked for signs of inflammation, they found that this, too, was significantly lower. The mice treated with the drug were more active and their median lifespan rose.</p>, <p>The scientists intend to continue exploring ways to prompt the human body to remove its old senescent cells, particularly to find means of activating the immune system to do this job.</p>, <p>That is, if future experimentation proves their theories correct, they could end up creating truly "anti-ageing" therapies.\xa0</p>, <p>The Week Mobile App</p>, <p>Copyright \xa9 2019 All rights reserved</p>]

The thinking is that nighttime gym visits rev up your system, making it hard to sleep.</p>, <p>But a new Swiss study is pouring cold water on this belief. Yep, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s OK to do cardio and pump iron at night, at least according to researchers at the Institute of Human Movement Sciences and Sport at ETH Zurich.</p>, <p>Investigators conducted a metanalysis of 23 studies on the topic. What they found was moderate amounts of exercise within a four-hour window of going to bed does not have a negative impact on sleep.</p>, <p>In fact, evening expenditure of energy may even be beneficial.</p>, <p>\u201cIf doing sport in the evening has any effect on sleep quality at all, it\u2019s rather a positive effect, albeit only a mild one,\u201d said Dr. <a href="http://www.epl.hest.ethz.ch/the-group/Team/Prof-Dr-Christina-M-Spengler-Walder.html">Christina Spengler</a>, Deputy Head of the Exercise Physiology Lab at ETH Zurich.</p>, <p>The results from the study support the idea that evening exercise encourages deeper, more meaningful sleep. The findings revealed that after an evening of physical activity, participants spent 21.2 percent of their sleeping time in deep sleep. But after an evening with no exercise, the average \u201cdeep sleep\u201d time was just 19.9 percent.</p>, <p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://guycounseling.com/missing-sleep-weight-gain-827/">Missing sleep may cause weight gain</a></p>, <p>There is an important caveat. Vigorous exercise within an hour of going to bed may cause sleep problems. The analysis shows, however, it is the only type of activity that may present issues.</p>, <p>\u201cThis preliminary observation is based on just one study,\u201d Spengler said.</p>, <p>Guy Counseling spoke to Chicago personal trainer <a href="https://goo.gl/oN1SxA">Mike Elder</a> about the research and his definition of vigorous exercise.</p>, <p>\u201cThe findings make a lot of sense. Many people exercise at night because they work during the day. I encourage clients to allow at least two hours after ending their workout and hitting the hey, which seems mostly agree with this study,\u201d says Elder.</p>, <p>He goes on to add, \u201cVigorous exercise would be something like cross-training; an activity that pulls in high-intensity activities and increases heart rate.\u201d</p>, <p>Dr. Spengler offers her own thoughts. \u201cAs a rule of thumb, vigorous training is defined as training in which a person is unable to talk. Moderate training is physical activity of an intensity high enough that a person would no longer be able to sing, but they could speak,\u201d says Spengler.</p>, <p>The important thing is to listen to your body. Because each of us had a <a href="https://guycounseling.com/body-clock-mood-515/">circadian rhythm</a> (your body clock), it\u2019s important to pay attention to how your system responds to exercise at different times of the day.</p>, <p>Jan Stutz, a doctoral student of Spengler\u2019s and lead author of the study shared the following. \u201cNot everyone reacts to exercise in the same way, and people should keep listening to their bodies,\u201d \u201cIf they notice they are having problems falling asleep after doing sport, they should try to work out a little earlier.\u201d</p>, <p>The research has been published in the <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsm/">Journal of Sports Medicine</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Do you exercise at night?

They share more about the research published in the January 3 online edition of <em>JAMA Oncology</em> (doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.6286):</p><p><strong>Q:\xa0 Why is this topic important to explore?</strong></p><p>A: Clinical sequencing assays are now routinely used to identify mutations in cancer for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Using these assays, the DNA from all cells within a specimen is sequenced, which include tumor cells as well as admixed stromal and blood cells. We previously reported that some mutations detected in targeted genome sequencing of patients with solid tumors arise from hematopoietic cells that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment. These mutations were due to an age-related condition known as <strong>c</strong>lonal <strong>h</strong>ematopoiesis of <strong>i</strong>ndeterminate <strong>p</strong>otential or CHIP. However, since CHIP shares its mutational landscape with other hematologic diseases, it can confound distinguishing CHIP from malignancies such as MPN. MPNs frequently have a mutation in the <em>JAK2</em> gene that alters the 617th amino acid residue from valine to phenylalanine. In this study, we sought to determine the cellular origin of <em>JAK2</em>-V617F in solid tumor sequencing and whether it was associated with a clinical diagnosis of a MPN. Recently published data attributed the detection of this mutation to the presence of CHIP, while others suggested that it arose in solid tumor cells.</p><p><strong>Q:\xa0 How did you approach this work and what did you discover? </strong></p><p>A: We analyzed clinical sequencing data from more than two thousand solid tumors tested at Rutgers Cancer Institute. Specimens from eight patients had <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations, but were present at abundances significantly different from that expected from tumor purity, suggesting they were either not present in all cancer cells or existed in a subset of non-cancer cells. Examination of clinical histories revealed that four of the eight patients had a diagnosis of a MPN while an additional patient had elevated platelet counts, which could indicate an unrecognized MPN. We performed manual macrodissection on paraffin-embedded specimens from three patients to enrich for solid tumor as well as hematopoietic cells and used highly sensitive sequencing and bioinformatics methods to detect mutations at very low abundances. In two of these patients with a diagnosis of MPN, the <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations were present in hematopoietic cells. In the third patient without prior diagnosis of MPN, we detected <em>JAK2</em>-V617F in the tumor cells. Interestingly, in one patient with MPN and in the one without MPN, we also detected CHIP-associated mutations in lymphocyte-enriched cell populations. Our study showed for the first time that <em>JAK2</em>-V617F identified in solid tumor sequencing can indicate a coexistent MPN with the mutation detected in infiltrating hematopoietic cells and not the solid tumor.\xa0\xa0</p><p><strong>Q:\xa0 What are the implications of these findings?</strong></p><p>A: There have been conflicting reports in the literature as to whether <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations detected in solid tumor sequencing assays are the result of alterations in the solid tumor or CHIP. Our analysis shows that although both of these results are possible, detection of <em>JAK2</em>-V617F can instead be associated with a coexistent MPN. This is of importance since the management of patients with a MPN would be different than with a patient that has the <em>JAK2</em>-V617F from CHIP or the solid tumor. These findings complement our previous work on CHIP and highlight the need for proper interpretation of variants detected in clinical sequencing of tumor samples. Specifically, when MPN-associated mutations are observed in solid tumor sequencing, caution is necessary for proper patient management and a hematologic workup should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.</p><p><em>This research was supported by the Comprehensive Genomics, Biomedical Informatics, and Biospecimen Repository Shared Resources at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (P30CA072720), the Rutgers Office of Advanced Research Computing (NIH\xa01S10OD012346-01A1), as well as pilot project funding from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.</em></p><p><em>###</em></p></p>, <p><strong>**EMBARGOED UNTIL THURSDAY, JANUARY 3, 2019 AT 11:00 AM EASTERN***</strong></p>, <p><strong>New Brunswick, N.J. \u2013 January 3, 2019 \u2013 </strong>Investigators at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey have uncovered that some mutations detected with targeted genome sequencing of patients with solid tumors are a result of a group of hematologic malignancies known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).

Using these assays, the DNA from all cells within a specimen is sequenced, which include tumor cells as well as admixed stromal and blood cells. We previously reported that some mutations detected in targeted genome sequencing of patients with solid tumors arise from hematopoietic cells that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment. These mutations were due to an age-related condition known as <strong>c</strong>lonal <strong>h</strong>ematopoiesis of <strong>i</strong>ndeterminate <strong>p</strong>otential or CHIP. However, since CHIP shares its mutational landscape with other hematologic diseases, it can confound distinguishing CHIP from malignancies such as MPN. MPNs frequently have a mutation in the <em>JAK2</em> gene that alters the 617th amino acid residue from valine to phenylalanine. In this study, we sought to determine the cellular origin of <em>JAK2</em>-V617F in solid tumor sequencing and whether it was associated with a clinical diagnosis of a MPN. Recently published data attributed the detection of this mutation to the presence of CHIP, while others suggested that it arose in solid tumor cells.</p>, <p><strong>Q:\xa0 How did you approach this work and what did you discover? </strong></p>, <p>A: We analyzed clinical sequencing data from more than two thousand solid tumors tested at Rutgers Cancer Institute. Specimens from eight patients had <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations, but were present at abundances significantly different from that expected from tumor purity, suggesting they were either not present in all cancer cells or existed in a subset of non-cancer cells. Examination of clinical histories revealed that four of the eight patients had a diagnosis of a MPN while an additional patient had elevated platelet counts, which could indicate an unrecognized MPN. We performed manual macrodissection on paraffin-embedded specimens from three patients to enrich for solid tumor as well as hematopoietic cells and used highly sensitive sequencing and bioinformatics methods to detect mutations at very low abundances. In two of these patients with a diagnosis of MPN, the <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations were present in hematopoietic cells. In the third patient without prior diagnosis of MPN, we detected <em>JAK2</em>-V617F in the tumor cells. Interestingly, in one patient with MPN and in the one without MPN, we also detected CHIP-associated mutations in lymphocyte-enriched cell populations. Our study showed for the first time that <em>JAK2</em>-V617F identified in solid tumor sequencing can indicate a coexistent MPN with the mutation detected in infiltrating hematopoietic cells and not the solid tumor.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Q:\xa0 What are the implications of these findings?</strong></p>, <p>A: There have been conflicting reports in the literature as to whether <em>JAK2</em>-V617F mutations detected in solid tumor sequencing assays are the result of alterations in the solid tumor or CHIP. Our analysis shows that although both of these results are possible, detection of <em>JAK2</em>-V617F can instead be associated with a coexistent MPN. This is of importance since the management of patients with a MPN would be different than with a patient that has the <em>JAK2</em>-V617F from CHIP or the solid tumor. These findings complement our previous work on CHIP and highlight the need for proper interpretation of variants detected in clinical sequencing of tumor samples. Specifically, when MPN-associated mutations are observed in solid tumor sequencing, caution is necessary for proper patient management and a hematologic workup should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.</p>, <p><em>This research was supported by the Comprehensive Genomics, Biomedical Informatics, and Biospecimen Repository Shared Resources at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (P30CA072720), the Rutgers Office of Advanced Research Computing (NIH\xa01S10OD012346-01A1), as well as pilot project funding from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.</em></p>, <p><em>###</em></p>, <p style="margin-top: 10px;">\n<a href="/home/contact/?topic=Article%20Comment&amp;subject=Comment%20for%20Article%20%23705886&amp;article=705886" target="_blank" title="Leave a comment...">Leave a comment...</a>\n</p>, <p>Newswise gives journalists access to the latest news and provides a platform for universities, institutions, and<br/> journalists to spread breaking news to their audience.</p>, <p class="copyright">\xa92018 Newswise, Inc</p>, <p>265 Turkey Sag Trail, Suite 102, #110, Palmyra VA 22963</p>]

[<p class="menuText">Menu</p>, <p>\n</p>, <p>A panel of experts have listed off the top five most addictive substances in the world.  And several of these substances are legal.  What are they and how can they affect your life?</p>, <p>This list was created by chemists, psychiatrists and pharmacologists.  Of the top five addictive drugs they ranked, the first on their list is heroin. Animal research has shown this opiate can increase dopamine levels in the brain by up to 200%.   Heroin use has risen sharply here in the US, and unfortunately, so has heroin-related overdose deaths.  </p>, <p>Next on the list is cocaine.  This drug also affects dopamine levels by preventing the brain from turning off the signal.  And animal research found cocaine can raise levels to more than 3 times the normal rate.   </p>, <p>Third on this list is nicotine.   It\u2019s found naturally in tobacco and here in the US, more people are addicted to nicotine than any other drug.  Which is unfortunate as tobacco smoke has over 7,000 chemicals, and roughly 70 of them can cause cancer.  </p>, <p>Number four on the list are barbiturates, otherwise known as \u201cdowners".  This class of drugs can cause euphoria and high doses can suppress breathing which can be deadly.  </p>, <p>And the last drug may surprise you.  And that\u2019s alcohol.  Animal research has shown alcohol can raise dopamine levels in the brain anywhere between 40% and 360%.  And the more that was drank, the higher the dopamine level.  </p>, <p>Dopamine is certainly the brain\u2019s pleasure chemical but drug addiction is very complex.  So I have some prescriptions to share:</p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p>Get help for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety or PTSD.  Because drug abuse often goes hand in hand with these disorders as many use drugs as a way to cope. Learn how to handle the pressures of life.  Please don\u2019t use drugs as a way to unwind or ease stress. It\u2019s best to avoid all illicit drugs.  And be careful not to misuse or abuse prescription drugs.  And lastly, if you have teenagers, talk to them openly and honestly about drugs.  Communication is essential when it comes to prevention. \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n</p>, <p></p>]
[<p>Hawaii's new medically-assisted suicide law has gone into effect, but few doctors and pharmacies are willing to prescribe and dispense the life-ending medications.<br/></p>, <p>Hawaii Pacific Health and The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu said their pharmacies will not fill the prescriptions and hospitalized patients will not be able to take the lethal drugs on their campuses, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday.</p>, <p>The law allows doctors to fulfill requests from terminally ill patients for prescription medication that will allow them to die.</p>, <p>The law's restrictions require two health care providers to confirm a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, ability to make decisions and that the request is voluntary. Patients must make three requests for the medication, voicing two at least 20 days apart and writing the third signed by two witnesses.</p>, <p>Most health care facilities have adopted neutral policies on the law, leaving it up to individual doctors to decide whether to participate.</p>, <p>"There are a number of health care providers, nurses and others who are really uncomfortable about this, so asking anybody to participate as a patient ends their life is a really tough thing," said Melinda Ashton, chief quality officer for Hawaii Pacific Health, one of the state's largest health care providers. "The most recent barrier does seem to be we haven't yet located a pharmacy willing to provide the medication."</p>, <p>CVS Pharmacy said pharmacists in Hawaii will follow a "carefully outlined process for the filling of such prescriptions under the limited circumstances" defined by law. Individual pharmacists will decide whether to fill the prescriptions, the company said.</p>, <p>Physicians might be resistant to the law at first, said Dr. Daniel Fischberg, medical director of the Queen's Medical Center Pain and Palliative Care Department.</p>, <p>"There's definitely diversity of opinion. A minority of physicians feel prepared to actually participate in terms of writing a prescription," Fischberg said.</p>, <p>The Hawaii Department of Health projects that 40 to 70 patients will seek medical aid in dying this year. Care providers and the state health department are offering training sessions to medical personnel on how to handle requests for life-ending medication.</p>, <p>\n<a data-alertme="" data-alertme-publisher="KCRA" data-alertme-solid="" data-alertme-uid-local="liid" href="#" title="Follow this story to get instant e-mail alerts from KCRA on the latest developments and related topics.">AlertMe</a>\n</p>, <p class="footer-copyright-disclaimer">Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites.</p>]

[<p>THURSDAY, Jan. 3, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Infection with the hepatitis C virus can cause liver disease and even liver cancer. But once found, the virus can be cured, so screening is vital for those at risk, health experts say.</p>, <p>For hepatitis A and B, preventive vaccines exist, but there is none for hepatitis C.</p>, <p>"We can eliminate the virus and keep people from developing liver disease," said Dr. James Spicher, an internal medicine physician at Penn State Health. "But we can only do that if we find it. That's why screening is so important. Otherwise, it's a silent disease."</p>, <p>Hepatitis C causes chronic inflammation of the liver. Over time, it can lead to scarring, cirrhosis, liver disease or liver cancer. It's one of the leading causes of liver failure and the need for liver transplants.</p>, <p>Recently developed antiviral drugs can now cure nine out of 10 people who have hepatitis C. These medications are more effective and have fewer side effects than the treatments used in the past.</p>, <p>Because hepatitis C can take decades to cause noticeable liver damage, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend screening people who are between 53 and 73 years of age. </p>, <p>Many people who have hepatitis C got it through a blood transfusion or medical procedure before labs began screening for the virus in the early 1990s.  </p>, <p>Hepatitis C causes mild, flu-like symptoms that last a couple of weeks and then go away. But the virus can hide in the liver undetected for years. </p>, <p>The CDC recommends everyone born between 1945 and 1965 get a one-time blood test for hepatitis C during a regular checkup.</p>, <p>"Those are the people who are most at risk now," Spicher said in a Penn State news release. </p>, <p>Hepatitis C cases also are on the rise due to the opioid crisis and heroin users who share needles. The virus is often detected when users go for treatment and have routine screenings, Spicher added. </p>, <p><b>More information</b></p>, <p>For more about hepatitis C, visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm/" target="_blank"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>, <p class="source">SOURCE: Penn State Health, news release,  Dec. 19, 2018 </p>, <p class="author">-- <a href="http://www.healthday.com/healthday-editors-reporters.html#22" target="_blank"><span itemprop="author"> Steven Reinberg</span></a></p>, <p class="pubdate">Last Updated: <time datetime="Jan 3, 2019" itemprop="dateModified">Jan 3, 2019</time></p>, <p class="copyright">Copyright \xa9 2019 <a href="http://www.healthday.com/" target="_blank">HealthDay</a>.

[<p>Futurity is your source of research news from leading universities.</p>, <p>(Credit: <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/close-up-portrait-of-young-woman-royalty-free-image/979566996" target="_lank">Getty Images</a>)</p>, <p>You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>, <p>Young women who experience sexual partner violence in their first relationships don\u2019t all experience it the same way, researchers say.</p>, <p>The new study, which identifies the various risk factors linked to sexual violence, suggests predicting teen partner rape could be a step toward preventing it.</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that sexual violence doesn\u2019t happen in relationships\u2014certainly not in young women\u2019s first relationships\u2014which is absolutely not the case,\u201d says Angie Kennedy, associate professor of social work at Michigan State University.</p>, <p>\u201cWe wanted to examine the most severe forms of sexual violence\u2014rape and attempted rape\u2014to better understand the specific risk factors linked to partner rape among young women. Our results can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing sexual violence among young people.\u201d</p>, <p>Kennedy and colleagues interviewed 148 college-aged women between the ages of 18 and 24 who experienced partner violence in at least one prior relationship. To get a diverse sample, they recruited participants from a university, a two-year college, and community sites serving low-income young women, including a county health clinic and a transitional living program.</p>, <p>In the interviews, the researchers asked the young women to talk about all of their partner relationships, starting with their first relationship, which began when they were around 15 years old on average.</p>, <p>The results showed consistent risk factors for partner rape across the three groups of women. During their first relationships, lower socioeconomic status, younger age, and higher levels of physical abuse and coercive control predicted sexual violence.</p>, <p>Key risk factors across all of the young women\u2019s relationships include a greater age difference between them and their partners, physical abuse, and coercive control.</p>, <p>\u201cRape or attempted rape in a relationship isn\u2019t typically an isolated incident. It\u2019s usually connected with other forms of abuse or coercion,\u201d says Kennedy, lead author of the paper in the <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260518811439">Journal of Interpersonal Violence</a></em>. \u201cYoung age and higher age difference between adolescent girls and their male partners may make them more vulnerable to experiencing abuse, particularly partner rape.\u201d</p>, <p>The researchers also found differences in the rate of sexual violence across the three groups.</p>, <p>While young women from the university group had a higher rate of partner rape in their first relationship, their rate dropped significantly over the course of all of their relationships in comparison to the two-year college students, who experienced an increase in partner rape over the course of their relationships.</p>, <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that young women are all alike in terms of what they go through\u2026\u201d</p>, <p>The findings suggest that experiences with partner abuse, much like the three groups of young women, are diverse.</p>, <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that young women are all alike in terms of what they go through, or that experiences are consistent across all relationships. For prevention and intervention efforts to work, we will need to take this diversity into account,\u201d Kennedy says.</p>, <p>Past studies tended to focus on sexual assault as it relates to college campuses. The new study focuses on young women\u2019s first relationships as well as all of their relationships over the course of adolescence and emerging adulthood; it\u2019s also the first to compare these different groups in terms of their experiences with partner abuse.</p>, <p>\u201cMost college-aged sexual assault research focuses on residential colleges and universities where there is dorm life, drinking on campus, and co-ed living,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cBut there are more than 5 million students enrolled at two-year community colleges in the United States and even more who don\u2019t pursue a higher ed degree. We need to get beyond four-year institutions and learn more about these other groups\u2019 experiences with partner abuse.\u201d</p>, <p>The researchers will next examine young women\u2019s disclosure of physical and sexual partner abuse, and the role of labeling and stigma in shaping mental health outcomes associated with abuse.</p>, <p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2019/what-predicts-teen-partner-rape/?utm_campaign=standard-promo&amp;utm_source=msunewstwitter-post&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Michigan State University</em></a></p>, <p>\n<a class="source-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260518811439" target="_blank">Original Study</a>\n                                                        DOI: 10.1177/0886260518811439                                                    </p>, <p>Add your information below to receive daily updates.</p>]

Researchers have uncovered that specific type 2 diabetes drugs may increase a patient\u2019s risk of a cardiovascular event such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, or amputation.</p>, <p>Lead author of the study Dr. Matthew O\u2019Brien explained, \u201cPeople should know if the medications they\u2019re taking to treat their\xa0diabetes\xa0could lead to serious cardiovascular harm. This calls for a paradigm shift in the treat of type 2 diabetes.\u201d</p>, <p>The two drugs identified were sulfonylureas and basal insulin. These drugs are commonly prescribed after a patient has used metformin but was unsuccessful.</p>, <p>The first study looked at how six major second-line medications affected the heart of type 2 diabetics.</p>, <p>Basal insulin is a slow releasing insulin. Other insulins are fast acting and intended to be taken prior to a meal, whereas basal insulin is released throughout the course of a day.</p>, <p>Around 60 percent of patients who require a second-line drug receive either basal insulin or sulfonylureas, but patients taking these drugs tend to have a higher cardiovascular risk than patients taking other types of second-line drugs like DPP-4 inhibitors.</p>, <p>O\u2019Brien added, \u201cAccording to our findings, we only have to prescribe basal insulin to 37 people over two years to observe one cardiovascular event, such as a\xa0heart attack, stroke,\xa0heart failure\xa0or amputation. For sulfonylureas, that number was a bit higher\u2014103 people. But when you apply these numbers to 30 million Americans with diabetes, this has staggering implications for how we may be harming many patients.\u201d</p>, <p>The authors suggest that doctors should opt for other classes of second-line medications in order to reduce the risk of heart disease and cardiovascular events from occurring. These alternatives include GLP-1 agonists, SGLT inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors. Unfortunately, many of these alternatives are more expensive than sulfonylureas or basal insulin, which is what makes them a more commonly prescribed option.</p>, <p>O\u2019Brien concluded, \u201cThis should force providers to think about cardiovascular effects of these drugs early in the course of diabetes treatment, and shift prescribing patterns to newer drugs that have more favorable cardiovascular profiles.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>Also read:</strong></p>, <p class="bm-author-bio-title"><strong>Author Bio</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" class="avatar avatar-150 photo avatar-default" height="150" src="https://www.belmarrahealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/emily-lunardo-150x150.jpg" width="150"/><b>Emily Lunardo</b> studied medical sociology at York University with a strong focus on the social determinants of health and mental illness.

[<p class="weather-summary__weather-conditions">Portland Weather Summary: 29 degrees</p>, <p class="alert-bar__description">107 Closing Alerts</p>, <p>According to the CDC, 80-thousand Americans died from the flu and flu-related complications during the 2017-2018 season. That was the highest number of flu deaths in four decades. In Maine, 82 people died-- the highest number of flu deaths in 5 years.\xa0</p>, <p>This year, so far, looks a lot different. \xa0The CDC reports 270 deaths nationwide as of December 28th. In Maine, 2 people have died from the flu as of December 29th. \xa0</p>, <p>Dr. August Valenti is the hospital epidemiologist at Maine Medical Center. He says the flu vaccine varies in it's efficacy. Last year\u2019s vaccine was not very effective.This year\u2019s vaccine is different.</p>, <p>"The predominant strain is H1N1, and the vaccine is 98.7% effective against that strain right now," Dr. Valenti said.\xa0</p>, <p>So if there\u2019s no flu outbreak, and we\u2019re mid-way through winter, is still worth getting vaccinated?</p>, <p>Dr. Valenti says that\u2019s a no-brainer.</p>, <p>"Maine is still rated by the CDC as being sporadic which means we\u2019re not seeing big outbreaks and focused outbreaks so i think that it is absolutely imperative that people get vaccinated," Dr. Valenti said.\xa0</p>, <p>Doctor Valenti says everyone should get a vaccine, but populations like the very young and the elderly NEED to get it.</p>, <p>"Patients for instance who have cancer and are on chemotherapy, patients with certain kinds of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, those patients are most vulnerable. And so, if you are living with a family member that is vulnerable, that\u2019s another reason to get the influenza vaccine," Dr. Valenti said.</p>, <p>Maine Medical Center has a list of influenza FAQ's on their website.\xa0</p>]
[<p><strong>1. Situation update</strong></p>, <p>The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite security challenges which have temporarily disrupted key response activities in some affected areas, notably Beni and Butembo. These response activities are progressively resuming. On 1 January 2019, six new confirmed cases were reported from Beni (2), Butembo (2) and Katwa (2). Only one case was a known contact; investigations are underway to establish the epidemiological links of the other cases.</p>, <p>During the reporting period (26 December 2018 - 1 January 2019), 23 newly confirmed cases were reported from Beni (4), Butembo (4), Kalunguta (2), Katwa (4), Komanda (2), Mabalako (1), and Oicha (6) health zones.</p>, <p>As of 1 January 2019, a total of 608 EVD cases, including 560 confirmed and 48 probable cases (Table 1), were reported from 16 health zones in the two neighbouring provinces of North Kivu and Ituri (Figure 1), of which 10 health zones reported at least one confirmed case in the last 21 days (12 December 2018 - 1 January 2019). Over this period, 103 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health zones, the majority of which were concentrated in major urban centres and towns in Beni (12), Butembo (13), Mabalako (13), Katwa (22), Komanda (21), and Oicha (10), which remain the main hotspots of this outbreak. As of 1 January 2019, no new cases were reported among healthcare workers, leaving the number of affected healthcare workers at 54, including 18 deaths.</p>, <p>Trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas. The reported number of cases in epidemiological week 52 (24 - 30 December 2018) has decreased compared to that of week 51 (17 - 23 December 2018), with 19 new confirmed cases in week 52 compared to 35 new confirmed cases in week 51. However, active case finding, laboratory diagnosis, and data reporting were disrupted during week 52, which led to an under-reporting of cases, particularly in Beni and Butembo. During week 52, the number of reported deaths among confirmed cases was 11 of which seven (64%) were community deaths. Community deaths were reported in Beni (1), Butembo (1), Katwa (1), Komanda (1), Mabalako (1), and Oicha (2). As of 1 January 2018, a cumulative total of 368 deaths were reported, including 320 deaths among confirmed cases. The case fatality among confirmed cases is 57% (320/560).</p>, <p>The MoH, WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the above-mentioned outbreak affected areas.</p>, <p class="big">A service provided by\n          <a class="logo-ocha" href="https://www.unocha.org"></a></p>, <p class="big">ReliefWeb has been the leading online source for reliable and timely humanitarian information on global crises and disasters since 1996.<br/><a href="/about">Learn more about ReliefWeb</a></p>, <p>As 2018 is drawing to a close, the release of a new set of humanitarian icons may well be OCHA\u2019s end-of-year gift to all of us working in digital communications.</p>, <p>\n<a class="footer-block__highlight-link" href="/blog">Visit the blog</a>\n</p>, <p>Share information through ReliefWeb to better inform humanitarians worldwide.</p>]
[<p>MARSHALL COUNTY, Ala. - Law enforcement officers across Marshall County now have access to training through Marshall Medical Centers to better identify and handle opioid overdoses.</p>, <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports on average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose.</p>, <p>Drug overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States. The CDC reports around 68% of drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid. A recent report claims fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses.</p>, <p>"There's a high probability these days that a police officer will encounter someone that's OD-ing from an opioid or fentanyl," said Guntersville Police Chief Jim Peterson.</p>, <p>His officers are not immune to those calls. Neither is Assistant Director of EMS for Marshall Medical Centers Jacob Babb, who has been a paramedic for about ten years.</p>, <p>"We may have five or six in one day, or we may not have one for a couple, two or three days," Babb said.</p>, <p>He is involved in a program through Marshall Medical Centers that trains law enforcement officers across the county on opioid overdoses.</p>, <p>"Basically what we're teaching them is to identify an overdose, how to treat the patient during that time prior to administration of the medication. Of course we teach them how to administer the medication, and what to do afterwards when they're waiting for EMS to arrive," Babb explained.</p>, <p>The program also supplies officers and their K9s with Narcan, which is designed to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and can be used if the officer comes in contact with fentanyl, which can be deadly.</p>, <p>"Already we've had two reports back where police officers have given it in the situation and actually saved lives," Babb said.</p>, <p>Often, law enforcement officers are the first on scene and the first to give aid. The program gives officers more tools and knowledge on how to better handle that life or death situation.</p>, <p><strong>Filed in:</strong> <a href="https://whnt.com/category/news/northeast-alabama/" rel="category tag">Northeast Alabama</a> </p>, <p>\n<a href="https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/whnt-tv" target="_blank">Online Public File\t\t </a> \u2022 \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t<a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> \u2022\n\t\t<a href="http://privacy.tribunemedia.com/">Privacy Policy</a> <br class="visible-phone"/> \u2022\n\t\t200 Holmes Avenue, Huntsville, AL 35801 <br class="visible-phone"/> \u2022\n\t\tCopyright \xa9 2019, WHNT\t\t<br class="visible-phone"/> \u2022 <a href="http://tribunemedia.com">A Tribune Broadcasting Station</a> \u2022\n\t\tPowered by <a class="powered-by-wpcom" href="https://vip.wordpress.com/?utm_source=vip_powered_wpcom&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=VIP%20Footer%20Credit&amp;utm_term=whnt.com" rel="generator nofollow">WordPress.com VIP</a> </p>]

Winds WSW at 5 to 10 mph.</p>, <p class="text-center"><small><i class="fas tnt-info-circle"></i> Updated: January 3, 2019 @ 5:51 pm</small></p>, <p><strong>DEAR DR. ROACH:</strong> For the past four weeks now, I wake up during the night because both of my hands have gone numb. I work my hands to get the feeling back and walk around my house for about 20 minutes as I do hand exercises. This happens two or three times during the night. During the day I have no issues. I\u2019m 69 years old, female, in good health and take no medicine. Is this cause for concern? Do you have any recommendations for me? I\u2019d appreciate your advice. <em>\u2014 J.C.</em></p>, <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> By far, the most common cause of intermittent hand numbness is compression of the nerves of the hand, which happens in one of three common places: the carpal tunnel of the wrist; the cubital tunnel of the elbow; or the cervical spine, as a result of a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. The exact location of the symptoms gives a clue to which of these three it is.</p>, <p>Symptoms that are worse on the thumb side of the hand, with a sparing of the little finger, are coming from compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. These symptoms may also feel like they travel up the arm, as high as the elbow, and only occasionally higher.</p>, <p>Symptoms that go on the outside of the arm to the little finger are from compression of the ulnar nerve, and most people are familiar with this sensation from hitting that nerve, sometimes called the \u201cfunny bone.\u201d Compression of the neck can cause symptoms that travel down the arm and shoulder, but may still involve the hand.</p>, <p>Not everyone with a nerve compression has symptoms that exactly match the textbooks, and I often hear that the entire hand is involved. Making a precise, anatomical diagnosis sometimes can be done by a careful exam, but a definitive diagnosis is made most commonly, not by an MRI, but by an EMG test of the nerves, also called a nerve conduction test.</p>, <p>Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which I think is the most likely diagnosis in your case from what information I have, often are worse at night. When we sleep, the wrists may flex (palms toward forearm) or extend (like you are stopping traffic), and this puts pressure on the median nerve. Keeping the wrist in a neutral position with a splint sometimes can stop the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. People who don\u2019t respond to splinting may be treated with anti-inflammatories, but people with ongoing symptoms benefit most from a simple surgical repair. Surgery should be performed only on EMG-confirmed cases, in my opinion.</p>, <p><strong>DEAR DR. ROACH:</strong> Do you keep scrapes moist with antibiotic ointment and covered or let them dry out uncovered? There seems to be two schools of thought on this. <em>\u2014 N.E.</em></p>, <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Although many people do say to let wounds dry in the air, there is a clear consensus in medical opinion about it: Wounds that are kept clean, moist and protected heal MUCH faster than wounds that are allowed to get dry. So, cover with an ointment (if there is a concern for infection, triple antibiotic ointment is great) to keep it moist, then cover with a bandage to keep it clean and protected.</p>, <p>Readers may email questions to <a href="mailto:ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu">ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu</a> or request an order form of available health newsletters at 628 Virginia Dr., Orlando, FL 32803.

[<p class="caption">Children engaged with the Project: EVO treatment for the recommended amount of time reports high rates of satisfaction, says a study.\n<span class="credits"> \xa0 - \xa0Reuters</span>\n</p>, <p> A video game-based \u2018digital medicine\u2019 tool can help reduce symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention/deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study, published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, confirmed the feasibility and safety of the tool called Project: EVO, which delivers sensory and motor stimuli through an action video game experience.</p>, <p>As many as 50 per cent of children with ASD have some ADHD symptoms, with roughly 30 per cent receiving a secondary diagnosis of ADHD.</p>, <p>However, since ADHD medications are less effective in children with both disorders than in those with only ADHD, researchers are exploring alternative treatments.</p>, <p>Children with ASD and ADHD symptoms are also at high risk for impaired \u201ccognitive function,\u201d including the brain\u2019s ability to maintain attention and focus on goals while ignoring distractions.</p>, <p>As children reach school age and beyond, these cognitive impairments make it more difficult for them to set and achieve goals, as well as successfully navigate the demands of day-to-day life in the community.</p>, <p>\u201cOur study showed that children engaged with the Project: EVO treatment for the recommended amount of time, and that parents and children reported high rates of satisfaction with the treatment,\u201d said Benjamin Yerys, a child psychologist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in the US.</p>, <p> \u201cBased on the promising study results, we look forward to continuing to evaluate the potential for Project: EVO as a new treatment option for children with ASD and ADHD,\u201d said Yerys. </p>, <p>The study included 19 children aged 9-13 diagnosed with ASD and co-occurring ADHD symptoms. Participants in the study were given either the Project: EVO treatment, which is delivered via an action video game experience, or an educational activity involving pattern recognition.</p>, <p>Key secondary outcome measures were caregiver reports of ADHD symptoms and the ability of the child to plan and complete tasks, as well as a cognitive test battery assessing working memory.</p>, <p>The study found that children adhered to the treatment protocol by engaging with the treatment for 95 per cent or more of the recommended treatment sessions.</p>, <p>Both parents and children reported that the treatment had value for improving a child\u2019s ability to pay attention and served as a worthwhile approach for treatment.</p>, <p>The study also found that after using Project: EVO, children showed a trend toward improved attention, and they showed general ADHD symptom improvement based on parent reports.</p>, <p>Though the sample size of the study was small, the study showed that using Project: EVO was feasible and acceptable with potentially therapeutic effects. The research team is planning a larger follow-up study for continued evaluation of Project: EVO\u2019s potential efficacy. </p>, <p class="infinite-story-link">Prepare a plan to boost research in state varsities: PM to scientific panel</p>, <p class="lt-ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 18:31 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 18:30 IST">The rover to observe lunar surface and send data useful for analysis of\xa0...</p>, <p class="lt-ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 17:02 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 16:59 IST">The first detailed images beamed back by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft\xa0...</p>, <p class="lt-ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 16:53 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 16:42 IST">Study finds after using Project: EVO, children show a trend towards\xa0...</p>, <p class="lt-ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 17:56 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 16:12 IST">Adds Jai Anusandhan to Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and Jai Vigyan</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 21:53 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 21:41 IST">SAIC, Kia will pull out all the stops to woo Indian car buyers</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 21:51 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 21:40 IST">Executive Director Rakesh Sharma is equally upbeat about Bangladesh where the company intends to strengthen\xa0...</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 21:50 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 21:38 IST">Vehicle manufacturers and suppliers across Europe and India need to be prepared for huge disruptions</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 21:47 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 21:36 IST">Testing the Ceed Sportswagon and the Stonic in and around Frankfurt reinforces the view that they should be\xa0...</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: December 30, 2018 16:42 IST\rPublished: December 30, 2018 13:59 IST">Admit your mistakes, make your money work and update your portfolio in 2019</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: December 30, 2018 16:46 IST\rPublished: December 30, 2018 13:59 IST">Trends building up in the housing market could provide good opportunities</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: December 30, 2018 16:38 IST\rPublished: December 30, 2018 14:05 IST">Deposit/lending rates are unlikely to see sharp changes in the near term</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: January 3, 2019 19:05 IST\rPublished: January 3, 2019 18:46 IST">Investors with a short-term horizon can consider buying the stock of Praj Industries at current levels.The\xa0...</p>, <p class="ltext" title="Updated: December 28, 2018 17:27 IST\rPublished: December 28, 2018 17:27 IST">What a year 2018 has been!

Now, a multi-institutional team of researchers has developed a wireless system that can measure bladder function in freely moving rats over days to weeks.

The implantable device provides a\xa0\u201cset it and forget it\u201d neuromodulation that delivers intermittent therapy that can diminish the urge to urinate, only when it is needed, and without any outside intervention.</p>, <p>The researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, developed an approach that uses techniques in optogenetics, soft electronics, data analytics, and wireless powering/communication technologies to address overactive bladder in animals. This technology could be used for people who suffer from bladder problems and could even extend beyond the bladder to other tissues and organs of the body.</p>, <p>The work was published in a paper titled, \u201c<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0823-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A wireless closed-loop system for optogenetic peripheral neuromodulation\u201d\xa0</a>in <em>Nature </em>on January 2.</p>, <p>The device is a strain gauge (a soft, stretchy belt-like device) that is implanted so that it\xa0wraps around the bladder (nothing is actually implanted into the bladder.)\xa0It is engineered so that\xa0the electrical resistance increases as it stretches and decreases as it relaxes. In turn, the\xa0strain gauge measures size changes of the bladder, not pressure inside the bladder. However,\xa0the bladder pressure correlates directly to the resistance measured with the strain gauge. So, when the bladder is filling and pressure in the bladder is increasing, the strain gauge signals this with an increase in resistance, and when the bladder empties and thus bladder pressure is decreasing, the bladder gets smaller, and the strain gauge signals this by a decrease in resistance.</p>, <p><figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_112055" style="width: 300px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-112055 size-medium" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-1392x928.jpg 1392w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Device-4-1260x840.jpg 1260w" width="300"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The device uses light signals from tiny LEDs to activate nerve cells in the bladder and control problems such as incontinence and overactive bladder. [Gereau lab, Washington University]</figcaption></figure>When the device is activated, the LED turns on.\xa0The light from the LED activates an opsin (a light-sensitive protein) called archaerhodopsin, which is expressed in the sensory neurons innervating the bladder neurons using a viral gene therapy vector.\xa0This allows the researchers to use optogenetics, the use of light to control cell behavior in living tissue, to activate certain cells. When archaerhodopsin is activated, it changes the properties of the nerve membranes causing inhibition of neuronal firing. Thus, the LED activation results in specific inhibition of the\xa0neurons that send signals from the bladder to the brain.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen the bladder is emptying too often, the external device sends a signal that activates micro-LEDs on the bladder band device, and the lights then shine on sensory neurons in the bladder. This reduces the activity of the sensory neurons and restores normal bladder function,\u201d Robert W. Gereau IV, PhD, professor at Washington University in St. Louis and director of the Washington University Pain Center tells\xa0<em>GEN</em>.</p>, <p>Gereau notes that one of their big questions from the beginning was whether they would be able to obtain sufficient silencing of neuronal activity coming from the bladder to impact bladder function. The device was not the concern because they knew there was more than enough light power coming from the implanted LED system. Rather, they did not know whether the viral gene therapy vector would target enough of the sensory neurons in the bladder so that turning on the light would inhibit enough of the sensory information coming from the bladder to reduce voiding. But,\xa0senior author John Rogers, PhD, professor of materials science and engineering, biomedical engineering and neurological surgery at Northwestern University, tells\xa0<em>GEN\xa0</em>that they were surprised by the efficacy of this approach.</p>, <p>Rogers and Gereau envision that a reasonable prototype could be available within a couple of years, but, that there are some key next steps that have to be worked out.\xa0Gereau notes that, \u201cfirst and foremost, a gene therapy vector suitable for use in humans will need to be developed and rigorously tested for safety.\u201d He adds that, \u201cthis needs to provide long-term, stable expression of an inhibitor opsin that has no safety issues.\u201d There are several ongoing gene therapy clinical trials, including some using optogenetics, so this should be achievable.\xa0\u201cSecond, we need to scale and adapt this system for use in the human bladder. We feel that this will be relatively straightforward, as the miniaturization necessary to have this closed-loop system work in a rat was a major advance here.\u201d</p>, <p>Although bladder function is quite similar between rat and human, the human bladder is much larger and the tissue is thicker which could limit the ability of the light to penetrate the tissue to activate the inhibitory channels expressed in the sensory neurons with the gene therapy vector. Therefore, for human application, a different mode of light delivery may be needed. This could mean the use of red light-activated opsins and red LEDs to activate them because red light penetrates biological tissues much more efficiently. Alternatively, the light sources could be placed inside the bladder to activate the sensor neuron endings that are in the superficial cell layers inside the bladder.</p>, <p><figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_112056" style="width: 300px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-112056 size-medium" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/189389_web-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/189389_web-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/189389_web-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/189389_web-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/189389_web.jpg 720w" width="300"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This CT scan of a rat shows a small device implanted around the bladder.

[<p>The first comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of adults with autism shows that despite having an intact IQ, these adults have medium to large impairments in four key social- and non-social cognitive domains: theory of mind, emotion perception and knowledge, processing speed, and verbal learning and memory.</p>, <p>The results may help create a roadmap for treating autism in adults, a population that is less studied and understood than children with the condition.</p>, <p>The meta-analysis was conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in collaboration with City University London and published Wednesday, January 2, in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>.</p>, <p>Autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While autism affects functioning in many domains throughout an individual's lifespan, research and treatment efforts have largely been dedicated to children. A critical question that has remained largely unaddressed is whether there are cognitive domains that are more severely impaired than others. Despite the efforts of individual studies to increase the understanding of cognitive deficits in adults with autism, sample sizes were often small, yielding inconsistent findings.</p>, <p>To directly compare the relative severity of impairments across cognitive domains in adults, Mount Sinai researchers aggregated all available autism literature and conducted a systematic review and analysis. Specifically, researchers from the Seaver Autism Center conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of autism-related studies published in the PubMed, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases between 1980 (first inclusion of autism diagnosis in the DSM-III (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and July 2018. Studies were included if they were published as a primary peer-reviewed research paper in English, included individuals with autism aged 16 or over, and assessed at least one domain of neurocognitive functioning or social cognition using standard measures. The meta-analysis included 75 studies and a combined sample of 3,361 individuals with autism and 5,344 neurotypical adults.</p>, <p>"Our findings have important implications for cognitive interventions in adults with autism. Current interventions for these individuals are primarily focused on improving individual adaptive social skills and social functioning," says Tjasa Velikonja, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Seaver Autism Center and first author of the paper. "While our results support the key social cognitive theories of autism treatments, they also highlight the importance of a broader approach when studying cognition and support interventions that also include non-social cognitive domains."</p>, <p><a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/" target="_blank">https://www.mountsinai.org/</a></p>, <p class="categories">Posted in: <a href="/category/Medical-Research-News.aspx">Medical Research News</a> | <a href="/category/Medical-Condition-News.aspx">Medical Condition News</a></p>, <p class="tags">Tags: <a href="/?tag=/Autism" rel="tag">Autism</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Brain" rel="tag">Brain</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Cardiology" rel="tag">Cardiology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Children" rel="tag">Children</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Diagnostics" rel="tag">Diagnostics</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Ear" rel="tag">Ear</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Education" rel="tag">Education</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Eye" rel="tag">Eye</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Gastroenterology" rel="tag">Gastroenterology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Genetics" rel="tag">Genetics</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Geriatrics" rel="tag">Geriatrics</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Heart" rel="tag">Heart</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Heart+Surgery" rel="tag">Heart Surgery</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Hospital" rel="tag">Hospital</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Medical+School" rel="tag">Medical School</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Medicine" rel="tag">Medicine</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Molecular+Biology" rel="tag">Molecular Biology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Nephrology" rel="tag">Nephrology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Neuroimaging" rel="tag">Neuroimaging</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Neurology" rel="tag">Neurology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Neurosurgery" rel="tag">Neurosurgery</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Ophthalmology" rel="tag">Ophthalmology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Psychiatry" rel="tag">Psychiatry</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Research" rel="tag">Research</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Surgery" rel="tag">Surgery</a>, <a href="/?tag=/therapeutics" rel="tag">therapeutics</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Throat" rel="tag">Throat</a></p>, <p id="cancelReply" style="display:none;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="BlogEngine.cancelReply();">Cancel reply to comment</a></p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Dr. Lloyd Tran</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">An interview with Dr. Lloyd Tran, discussing the major barriers to Alzheimer\u2019s research and development over the past 40 years.</p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Richard Delle Bovi</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">In this interview, Richard Delle Bovi highlights live cell ability of the CELLESTIAL\xae analysis kit from Enzo Life Sciences and its applications in cell biology.</p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Dr Susan Tappan</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">In this interview conducted at SfN 2018, Susan Tappan explains the benefits of whole slide imaging and how MBF have collaborated with Huron to achieve repeatable whole slide imaging workflows.</p>, <p class="site-disclaimer">\r\n\r\n                                          \r\n                                                News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r\n                                                with these <a href="/medical/terms">terms and conditions</a>.\r\n                                                Please note that medical information found\r\n                                                on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r\n                                                between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r\n                                          \r\n                                          \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                    </p>, <p class="hon-code"><a href="https://www.healthonnet.org/HONcode/Conduct.html?HONConduct683179" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"> <img alt="This website is certified by Health On the Net Foundation.

[<p>Scientists are narrowing in on checklists of both errant genes and the environmental factors that could trigger those genes to more accurately assess type 1 diabetes risk and help children and their families avoid it.</p>, <p>"The next five years is the time to put the puzzle together," says Dr. Jin-Xiong She, director of the Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Genomic Medicine.</p>, <p>She is talking about the TEDDY - The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young - study that started in 2003 at MCG and five other clinical centers across four countries and is following nearly 9,000 children and their families. She is principal investigator for studies in Georgia and Florida. TEDDY also has clinical centers in Colorado, Washington, Finland, Sweden and Germany.</p>, <p>"This will enable us to continue working with families, collecting and analyzing samples and data, for the next five years," says She, who recently received a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue his part of the studies in two of the most populous and fastest-growing states in the nation.</p>, <p>He's optimistic that the unprecedented, prospective study documenting how genes and environment collide to cause a condition that typically surfaces in youth and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, will enable prevention of the condition that affects about 1 in 300 by age 18, according to the NIH.</p>, <p>Today there is no proven way to prevent type 1 diabetes, which hits at the heart of what TEDDY is about, She says.</p>, <p>Two peak ages ranges for type 1 diabetes are 2-4 and 12-15 and since TEDDY began, parents have been keeping exhaustive diaries on everything from a well-baby visit to the doctor to vaccinations to over-the-counter drugs the children take. They also collect nail, stool and blood samples throughout the 15-years each child is being followed. Scientists have been analyzing it all, including the water children drink, which can vary from one metropolis to the next. The international scope of the study is enabling identification of even regional differences that may be factors in disease development.</p>, <p>The massive data that continues to be generated by some 9,000 TEDDY families is yielding previously unknown high-risk genes and environmental factors that will ultimately lead to those genetic and environmental checklists.</p>, <p>"How to predict risk is an important question, but the main question of TEDDY is what can we do about that risk?" She says. Ideally that will mean keeping the immune system of high-risk children from ever making autoantibodies against their insulin producing cells. That means screening should start early, probably within the first year of life, She says, possibly even as one of the blood tests done for newborns.</p>, <p>Next year, TEDDY participants start turning 15; right now, the average age is about 11. TEDDY investigators project about 450 children will be persistently autoantibody positive as they reach adolescence. TEDDY investigators would like to follow those children at least into adulthood.</p>, <p>The Georgia-Florida TEDDY contingent She leads includes about 600 children. To date 22 children have developed type 1 diabetes and another 58 are autoantibody positive. He suspects by the end of the next five years, about half those children will also have the disease.</p>, <p>Autoantibodies are evidence that the child's immune system has started to target the child's insulin producing cells. It's the attack and eventual destruction of the beta cells by the immune system that leave children dependent on insulin therapy the rest of their lives.</p>, <p>To date about 12 percent of TEDDY children had autoantibodies by age 10 and nearly 8 percent have multiple antibodies.</p>, <p>But in some young children, autoantibodies disappear and now TEDDY scientists are looking at whether autoantibodies reappear when those children reach adolescence and what factors are associated with recurrence versus remission. They also are looking at which autoantibodies are associated with slow versus rapid progression to full-blown type 1 diabetes. About 10 percent of children who develop autoantibodies don't develop disease and those children likely hold insight as well.</p>, <p>They suspect over the next five years as children age and more develop autoantibodies and/or disease, they'll find the triggering environmental factors will change as well, another reason investigators says five more years of monitoring is important.</p>, <p>Technological advances that have occurred over the life of TEDDY also now mean they can monitor advancement from a single to multiple autoantibodies to full-blown disease. Parallel environmental exposures over that timeframe already are providing more insight into causes and logical points for intervention.</p>, <p>To first enroll study participants, TEDDY screened for two known high-risk genes out of the handful of genes known at that time. Children with those genes - and no first-degree relative with the disease - have about a 3 percent disease risk, 10 times higher than children without those genes. Those with the genes and a first- degree relative with type 1 have about a 14 percent chance of <a class="linked-term" href="/health/What-is-Type-1-Diabetes.aspx">developing type 1 diabetes</a>. Identifying more high-risk genes should significantly improve the ability to identify risk, She says.</p>, <p>TEDDY has helped identify multiple additional high-risk genes with more to come, he says, and future screens will likely look at a few hundred genes.</p>, <p>"We are working on a new test that may analyze hundreds of genes that we think will be more accurate, more predictive," She says.</p>, <p>He says parallel general prevention strategies likely won't result, rather precision strategies based on a child's genetic, social, cultural, ethnic and geographical parameters.</p>, <p>Environmental factors include dietary triggers, so the scientists are now following up on observations already made in TEDDY like the fact that adequate vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of type 1 diabetes particularly in children with even one minor genetic variation on their vitamin D receptor gene. They've also found that exposure to probiotics in infancy decreases diabetes development risk in the highest risk children while consuming hydrolyzed infant formula - which is considered hypoallergenic and good for infants who can't digest cow milk - increases risk.</p>, <p>Scientists anticipate these additional years of study will enable dietary interventions to emerge that help prevent disease development.</p>, <p>They also are looking further at the psychosocial impact of the study itself as well as the disease on parents and children. TEDDY families experiencing maladjustments are offered counseling and the investigators already have noted issues such as: increased parent anxiety when an autoantibody is detected; parents who still underestimate the full impact of the disease; and parents who pursue unproven methods to prevent type 1 diabetes development.</p>, <p>Now that at-risk children are older, they can also talk with them about the emotional and behavioral impact, and look for signs of stress like presence of the stress hormone cortisol in their toenail clippings.</p>, <p>They also are generating data on the physical activity of the TEDDY participants and keeping measures of their body composition to explore how they might affect risk of developing autoantibodies and progression to type 1 diabetes.</p>, <p>While weight and inactivity are considered major risk factors for type 2 diabetes, "How much it contributes to type 1, we don't know," says She. "That is why we are looking, and in the next five years, we will be able to give you an answer."</p>, <p>They also are following the children for development of related autoimmune diseases like celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disease. About 9 percent of TEDDY participants, for example, have developed both celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune thyroid disease has genetic risk factors similar to type 1 diabetes, She says. "They are enriched in the TEDDY population, so we also want to identify those at high risk for autoimmune thyroid disease," She says. That likely means also developing better screening for these conditions, which often surface much later in life. In fact, the thyroid is the most common organ affected by autoimmune disease.</p>, <p>She and TEDDY research manager Diane Hopkins regularly laud the TEDDY families for their extraordinary commitment to the long, extensive study and recently hosted a party for about 300 TEDDY families from the two-state area they manage. Attrition has been low and some families even came back after dropping out, She notes.</p>, <p>"They want to help us better understand what is happening and they want to know what is happening," She says. "They have become part of the extended family."</p>, <p>The TEDDY consortium includes collaborators and principal investigators at Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida; Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle; Sweden's Lund University; the University of Colorado; Germany's Helmholtz Zentrum M\xfcnchen and Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit? M\xfcnchen and Forschergruppe Diabetes e.V.; and Finland's University of Turku and Turku University Hospital. Data generated by TEDDY is available to all scientists.</p>, <p>Type 1 diabetes can affect the entire body, cause heart and blood vessel disease, kidney, eye and foot damage and nerve damage. It generally reduces life expectancy by about a decade.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.augusta.edu/mcg/" target="_blank">http://www.augusta.edu/mcg/</a></p>, <p class="categories">Posted in: <a href="/category/Child-Health-News.aspx">Child Health News</a> | <a href="/category/Medical-Research-News.aspx">Medical Research News</a> | <a href="/category/Medical-Condition-News.aspx">Medical Condition News</a></p>, <p class="tags">Tags: <a href="/?tag=/Antibodies" rel="tag">Antibodies</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Anxiety" rel="tag">Anxiety</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Autoantibodies" rel="tag">Autoantibodies</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Autoimmune+Disease" rel="tag">Autoimmune Disease</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Baby" rel="tag">Baby</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Biotechnology" rel="tag">Biotechnology</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Blood" rel="tag">Blood</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Blood+Vessel" rel="tag">Blood Vessel</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Celiac+Disease" rel="tag">Celiac Disease</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Children" rel="tag">Children</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Cortisol" rel="tag">Cortisol</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Diabetes" rel="tag">Diabetes</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Doctor" rel="tag">Doctor</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Drugs" rel="tag">Drugs</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Eye" rel="tag">Eye</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Foot" rel="tag">Foot</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Gene" rel="tag">Gene</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Genes" rel="tag">Genes</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Genetic" rel="tag">Genetic</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Genomic" rel="tag">Genomic</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Heart" rel="tag">Heart</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Hormone" rel="tag">Hormone</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Hospital" rel="tag">Hospital</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Immune+System" rel="tag">Immune System</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Insulin" rel="tag">Insulin</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Kidney" rel="tag">Kidney</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Life+Expectancy" rel="tag">Life Expectancy</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Medicine" rel="tag">Medicine</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Nerve" rel="tag">Nerve</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Pancreas" rel="tag">Pancreas</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Physical+Activity" rel="tag">Physical Activity</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Probiotics" rel="tag">Probiotics</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Receptor" rel="tag">Receptor</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Research" rel="tag">Research</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Stress" rel="tag">Stress</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Thyroid" rel="tag">Thyroid</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Thyroid+Disease" rel="tag">Thyroid Disease</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Type+1+Diabetes" rel="tag">Type 1 Diabetes</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Type+2+Diabetes" rel="tag">Type 2 Diabetes</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Vitamin" rel="tag">Vitamin</a>, <a href="/?tag=/Vitamin+D" rel="tag">Vitamin D</a></p>, <p id="cancelReply" style="display:none;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="BlogEngine.cancelReply();">Cancel reply to comment</a></p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Dr. Lloyd Tran</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">An interview with Dr. Lloyd Tran, discussing the major barriers to Alzheimer\u2019s research and development over the past 40 years.</p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Richard Delle Bovi</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">In this interview, Richard Delle Bovi highlights live cell ability of the CELLESTIAL\xae analysis kit from Enzo Life Sciences and its applications in cell biology.</p>, <p class="hidden-sm">Dr Susan Tappan</p>, <p class="visible-sm-block">In this interview conducted at SfN 2018, Susan Tappan explains the benefits of whole slide imaging and how MBF have collaborated with Huron to achieve repeatable whole slide imaging workflows.</p>, <p class="site-disclaimer">\r\n\r\n                                          \r\n                                                News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r\n                                                with these <a href="/medical/terms">terms and conditions</a>.\r\n                                                Please note that medical information found\r\n                                                on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r\n                                                between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r\n                                          \r\n                                          \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                    </p>, <p class="hon-code"><a href="https://www.healthonnet.org/HONcode/Conduct.html?HONConduct683179" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"> <img alt="This website is certified by Health On the Net Foundation.

[<p class="head">Sections</p>, <p>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent health conditions of today's times. By the year 2030, 98 million Indians are estimated to be suffering from diabetes. But, how is diabetes caused? Diabetes is marked by elevated blood sugar levels. It is caused when body's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired severely. Diabetics are often recommended to take extra precautions when it comes to their diet. Not just food, they need to be very mindful of the liquid calories they consume through the day as well. Aerated beverages, cola, soda and alcohol may spike blood sugar levels in a big way, which is why experts advise of hydrating oneself with low-calorie healthy beverages that could also check surge in blood sugar levels.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>1. Fenugreek Water</strong></p>, <p>These bitter seeds are known to be packed with anti-diabetic properties. According to a study, published in the International Journal For Vitamin and Nutrition Research, taking 10 grams of fenugreek seeds soaked in hot water may help regulate type-2 diabetes. Also known as methi dana in Hindi, fenugreek seeds are a good source of fibre, which enables slow release of sugars in the bloodstream. Fenugreek is also known to improve the way your body uses sugar.</p>, <p>(Also Read:\xa0<a href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/5-vegetables-you-must-include-in-your-diabetes-diet-1867012">5 Vegetables You Must Include In Your Diabetes Diet</a>)</p>, <p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">These bitter seeds are known to be packed with anti-diabetic properties</p>, <p><strong>2. Cinnamon Water</strong></p>, <p>\xa0The flavourful spice is an age-old remedy to manage diabetes. According to a study, published in the American Diabetes Association, cinnamon may help improve glucose and lipid profile of people with type-2 diabetes. You can mix a teaspoon of cinnamon in a glass of water and drink the healing potion once in a day. Macrobiotic Nutritionist and Health Practitioner, Shilpa Arora tells us that cinnamon is packed with anti-diabetic compounds that may play a crucial role in reducing the rate at which glucose is released in our system. Consuming cinnamon water regularly also helps reduce fasting blood sugar as well as elevated levels of cholesterol in the body. Make sure you do not have more than 3-6 grams cinnamon powder in a day. Cinnamon is warming in nature; too much of spice may cause gastric problems.\xa0</p>, <p>(Also Read:\xa0<a href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/6-reasons-why-you-should-be-drinking-cinnamon-water-daily-1814994">6 Reasons Why You Should Be Drinking Cinnamon Water Daily</a>)</p>, <p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Cinnamon (Dalchini) for Diabetes:The flavourful spice is an age-old remedy to manage diabetes.</p>, <p><strong>3.

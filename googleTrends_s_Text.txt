[<p>In the end, the biggest match of the Premier League season so far more than lived up to the billing. Because not only was <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Manchester City" href="/soccer/teams/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a>\u2019s pulsating, back-and-forth 2-1 win over table-topping <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Liverpool" href="/soccer/teams/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> an instant classic; not only was it the Reds\u2019 first loss of the campaign; it also sets up a dramatic end to the best title race in recent memory, with more than four months of matches still to play.</p>, <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those games topping this one.</p>, <p>When England\u2019s best two teams last met in October, <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:it was a dud;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/unfortunately-neutral-fans-manchester-city-liverpool-pretty-much-punchless-183413788.html">it was a dud</a>. Liverpool and City were even on points then, and in retrospect it shouldn\u2019t have been surprising that what was always going to be a cagey contest ended scoreless.</p>, <p>The stakes were significantly higher on Thursday. The Reds entered the match at the Etihad leading City by a whopping seven points. That meant the home team would have to come out attacking, even if it meant risking punishment at the feet of the visitors\u2019 deadly counterattack.</p>, <p>That\u2019s how it played out when the whistle blew, too. But then Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team began to find their feet, and very nearly\xa0\u2014 oh, so nearly\xa0\u2014 the opening goal.</p>, <p>Instead, Sadio Mane hit the post after being played through by Mo Salah, and John Stones managed to clear what <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:would\u2019ve been a spectacular own-goal;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/manchester-city-narrowly-avoided-embarrassing-goals-video-203047263.html">would\u2019ve been a spectacular own-goal</a> off the line in the 18th minute:</p>, <p>In real time, it looked as though the ball was in. Referee\xa0<span>Anthony Taylor immediately looked at his watch for a signal from the electronic eye-in-the-sky that it had indeed crossed the line. None came, and they played on. Moments later, the millions of fans watching from every corner of the globe learned just how close the call actually was:\xa0</span></p>, <p>I mean\u2026 <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:pic.twitter.com/nW2ZRAEfHQ" href="https://t.co/nW2ZRAEfHQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/nW2ZRAEfHQ</a></p>, <p>\u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:January 3, 2019" href="https://twitter.com/NBCSportsSoccer/status/1080923354582958080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">January 3, 2019</a></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Mane had another chance to put the visitors ahead against reeling City moments later. But after his volley was squandered, Pep Guardiola\u2019s men seemed to regain their composure. And they took a 1-0 lead into the dressing room at halftime thanks to a brilliant individual goal by Sergio Aguero five minutes before the break.</p>, <p>When the second stanza began, the hosts appeared fully in control. But yet again, Liverpool willed its way back into the tilt. And it managed to find an equalizer through Roberto Firmino off a well-worked sequence in the 65th minute to set up what would be an epic finish to the contest:</p>, <p>The momentum had clearly swung back toward Liverpool at that point. And with the Reds not content to sit back and protect the point (not to mention their lead in the standings), it was defending champion City who capitalized on a counterattack of their own, Leroy Sane firing home the strike that would stand up as the winner with about 20 minutes left to play:</p>, <p>Both teams now have 17 games remaining. Even though Liverpool\u2019s lead atop the table was cut to four, Klopp and Co. still controls their own destiny. The Prem crown is still theirs to lose.</p>, <p>\u201cThe boys tried everything, we got nothing for it. That\u2019s how it is sometimes in life,\u201d Klopp said afterward, adding that he felt City defender Vincent Kompany should\u2019ve been sent off for a first-half foul on Salah. \u201c[If we] keep on going, everything will be fine for us.\u201d</p>, <p>Either way, things sure are a lot more interesting following a match that will surely go down as one of the greatest Premier League games ever played.</p>, <p><strong>More from Yahoo Sports:</strong><br/> <strong>\u2022 <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Ticket prices plummet for college football title game;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/title-game-ticket-prices-plummeting-90-percent-college-football-worried-214530894.html">Ticket prices plummet for college football title game</a><br/> \u2022 <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Steelers\u2019 Brown responds to ex-teammate, calls him \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/antonio-brown-responds-ex-teammate-ryan-clark-calling-uncle-tom-022147795.html">Steelers\u2019 Brown responds to ex-teammate, calls him \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019</a><br/> \u2022 <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Soaring TV ratings, streaming viewership an NFL bright spot;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-television-ratings-2018-games-five-percent-streaming-viewership-soars-211117632.html">Soaring TV ratings, streaming viewership an NFL bright spot</a><br/> \u2022 <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-ylk="slk:Thamel: How Saban\u2019s evolution changed Alabama;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/open-scoring-nick-sabans-evolution-changed-alabama-025126292.html">Thamel: How Saban\u2019s evolution changed Alabama</a><br/> </strong></p>]

Palace celebrates with James McArthur of Crystal Palace after scoring a goal to make it 0-1 during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and..." width="640"/></p>, <p>Crystal Palace's shortcomings in front of goal this season have been pretty evident as they struggle in the bottom half of the Premier League table.</p>, <p>Recent wins against the likes of Wolves and champions Manchester City have provided their supporters with some rest bite, but for the majority, they have failed to prove their attacking worth.\xa0</p>, <p>Palace are the third lowest scorers in England's top tier this season, with only 15th-placed Newcastle United and rock-bottom Huddersfield scoring less.\xa0</p>, <p>After <a href="/en-gb/topic/crystal-palace-fc/">the Eagles</a> beat high-flying Wolves 2-0 in their back yard, manager Roy Hodgson confirmed to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46741881" rel="nofollow">BBC Sport</a> after the match that their\xa0proposed loan move for Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke is off.\xa0</p>, <p>Despite the disappointing news from a Palace perspective, the club still needs to add depth and quality to their attacking department as they should turn their attention to Everton's Cenk Tosun.</p>, <p>The Turkey international has started only seven Premier League matches for Marco Silva's side this season as he has struggled for regular game time and form.</p>, <p><img alt="Harry Maguire of Leicester City and Cenk Tosun of Everton during the Premier League match between Everton FC and Leicester City at Goodison Park on January 1, 2019 in Liverpool, United..." height="454" src="https://cdn.hitc-s.com/i/1245/harry_maguire_of_leicester_city_and_cenk_tosun_of_everton_during_1037634.jpg" style="display: block;

2019 in Liverpool, United..." width="640"/></p>, <p>Everton's January 2018 signing has only found the back of the net on two occasions during this campaign but did score five goals in 14 league matches last term.</p>, <p>Tosun has proven that if he is provided with regular minutes on the pitch then he can, hold up the ball, be an aerial threat and find the back of the net - qualities\xa0that would suit Hodgson and Palace.\xa0</p>, <p><img alt="Kasper Schmeichel of Leicester City saves a header from Cenk Tosun of Everton during the Premier League match between Everton FC and Leicester City

[<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - NOVEMBER 23: Nassir Little #5 of the North Carolina Tar Heels dunks against Kris Wilkes #13 of the UCLA Bruins during the 2018 Continental Tire Las Vegas Invitational basketball tournament at the Orleans Arena on November 23, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Sam Wasson/Getty Images)</p>, <p class="speakable-content">The <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/11/27/personal-nba-top-50-according-san-antonio-spurs-values/">San Antonio Spurs</a> have been on a tear as of late, but they could still be in a position to nab a high-flying freshman out of Chapel Hill in Nassir Little. Bleacher Report\u2019s <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2811588-final-2019-nba-mock-draft-before-the-new-year#slide0">Jonathan Wasserman</a> compiled his last mock draft of 2018, in which he had Little slotted as being the 13th pick in the first round of the <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/12/18/san-antonio-spurs-early-2019-nba-draft-prospects-jarrett-culver/">2019 NBA Draft</a>.</p>, <p class="speakable-content">Despite being in the same recruiting class as the likes of <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/11/17/san-antonio-spurs-tank-zion-williamson/">Zion Williamson</a> and R.J. Barrett, it was Little who garnered the preseason accolades, being named the MVP and Co-MVP of the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic respectively. Such a feat placed Little in rarified air, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2811408-nassir-little-is-learning-the-hard-way">joining LeBron James as the only other to win MVP honors in both events.</a></p>, <p>Little, once considered a near-lock as a top-three pick coming into the season, has seen his draft stock drop off precipitously during his time playing in the Dean Dome.\xa0 Let\u2019s investigate how his game would translate to the Spurs system if\xa0San Antonio had the opportunity to select Little.</p>, <p>The 6\u20196\u2033 forward is currently averaging 10.8 points on 51.5 percent shooting and 4.2 rebounds in just 19.4 minutes of play over his first 12 collegiate games. On the surface, these numbers pale in comparison to that of players such as Williamson and Barrett.\xa0 Further, Little has connected on just five three-pointers all year on 21.7 percent shooting from downtown.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">It just hit me. Nassir Little's freshman year REALLY reminds me of Vince Carter's.</p>, <p>Vince played 18 minutes per game and averaged 7.5 points.</p>, <p>Nassir is playing 19 minutes per game and averaging 10.8 points.</p>, <p>Both showed flashes of brilliance &amp; both looked a bit lost at times too</p>, <p>\u2014 nbabeau (@NBABeau) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBABeau/status/1079070951067795456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2018</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>Seeing the raw numbers will undoubtedly create a healthy level of skepticism about Little\u2019s transition to the next level. However, there are several other factors at play that have prevented Little from producing in the same eye-popping manner UNC fans saw prior to his arrival on campus.</p>, <p>Little is joining a senior-laden Tar Heel roster, which has forced the freshman to adopt a bench role and that adjustment has resulted in a productivity drop-off as he transitions to the college game. Despite his early season fluctuations, Little\u2019s start to his freshman season is eerily similar to that of another <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/07/18/san-antonio-spurs-danny-green-trade-instagram/">Carolina</a> legend: Vince Carter.</p>, <p>It\u2019s safe to say Carter\u2019s career turned out just fine as he\u2019s currently the oldest player in the NBA at the ripe young age of 41 with 21 years of league experience under his belt. While it\u2019s impossible and irresponsible to say Little\u2019s career will follow the same trajectory as Carter\u2019s, it shows that Little\u2019s slow start and the system he\u2019s playing in should not be an indictment on his ability to produce at the next level.</p>, <p>One of the greatest traits that Little possesses is one that cannot be taught: athleticism. When asked about the subject, UNC head coach Roy Williams said that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ljTzoOXrY">Little is easily the most athletic player he\u2019s ever had the opportunity to coach</a>. With incredible explosion and leaping abilities, Little can glide through the lane and finish thunderous put back dunks.</p>, <p>Many teams and scouts will be enamored with Little\u2019s combination of size and speed, with the potential to develop into a two-way/3-and-D player if he\u2019s able to find a more consistent three-point shot. His strong 6\u20196\u2033, 220-pound frame coupled with his steady body control allows Little to absorb contact on drives and he has shown glimpses of instinctual positioning on the offensive glass for easy buckets.</p>, <p>While the physical traits are undeniable, Little has much room for growth on both ends of the floor to become a more well-rounded prospect. As mentioned, just the five three-point makes on the season at a low percentage is concerning. Further, Little has recorded just 10 assists this year (.08 APG), which is tied for seventh on the team and shows that he still has a ways to go as a facilitator and playmaker</p>, <p>As a fit for the <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/12/27/san-antonio-spurs-shouldve-sold-farm-luka-doncic/">Spurs</a>, Little is an ideal candidate. The two-way potential coincides perfectly with a team that\u2019s fundamentally rooted in defense. Plus, the addition of another explosive player to pair with the likes of a healthy <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/11/13/san-antonio-spurs-sorely-miss-dejounte-murray/">Dejounte Murray</a> and <a href="https://airalamo.com/2018/11/20/three-ways-lonnie-walker-can-jumpstart-san-antonio-spurs/">Lonnie Walker</a> would give Spurs fans a young and exciting core for years to come.</p>, <p>Currently, the Spurs\u2019 draft pick is hovering around the middle of the first round towards the back end of the lottery. While the Spurs do not traditionally trade up to acquire players.</p>, <p>If they believe Little is the piece they need they could consider packaging their two first round picks \u2013 including the Raptors first round pick they received from the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonaka01.html" ref="nofollow">Kawhi Leonard</a> trade \u2013 to select Little.</p>, <p>Build your own custom daily newsletter with updates on your favorite teams, sent directly to your inbox.</p>, <p class="privacy" style="color: #000000">Your privacy is safe with us.

[<p>LOUDONVILLE \u2014 His first home game complete as Siena College men\u2019s basketball head coach, Jamion Christian credited the program\u2019s fans for the energy they had brought that evening to Times Union Center despite a losing effort from the Saints.</p>, <p>\u201cJust knowledgeable fans. They really have a great understanding of it,\u201d Christian said after that November game. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great feeling in the building, and you want to do a great job for [the fans] because they support us so well.\u201d</p>, <p>Then came the subtle ask, a gentle request for some patience \u2014 one of the few times Christian has done that since his May hire.</p>, <p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Christian said, \u201cthey\u2019re pleased with our effort, and can kind of see where we\u2019re going with this thing and how it\u2019s going to build.\u201d</p>, <p>A little more than a month later, Siena provided an example of the on-court blueprint Christian is looking for his program to follow. In a <a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/12/29/siena-men-s-basketball-finishes-2018-with-blowout-win">21-point win against Cal Poly</a> to wrap their non-conference season, the <a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/12/31/defense-stars-in-latest-siena-men-s-basketball-win">Saints\u2019 defense was stifling</a> and they used a 21-point advantage from behind the 3-point line to key their offense.</p>, <p>In short, the Saints had finally produced the \u201cMayhem\u201d Christian promised.</p>, <p>\u201cIt will look like that,\u201d Christian said afterwards. \u201cIt will be a great defensive \u2014 and connected \u2014 effort with our ability to make outside shots really impacting the game.\u201d</p>, <p>As MAAC play starts 4 p.m. Thursday for Siena at Saint Peter\u2019s, the question for the Saints is how repeatable the effort they delivered against Cal Poly is for them the rest of this season. Siena brings a 5-8 mark into conference play after a non-conference season during which the Saints mostly struggled to implement with success key parts of Christian\u2019s strategy, such as the team\u2019s full-court pressure defense.</p>, <p>\u201cI love pressing,\u201d Christian said in mid-December. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the depth right now to do it consistently.\u201d</p>, <p>Siena has used its full-court press to slow opponents, but hasn\u2019t had much success turning over opponents. Partially, that is because too many current Saints lack the needed combination of height and foot speed \u2014 for most, the latter has been the larger issue \u2014 to make the press work. Looking ahead to next season, Christian said the infusion of incoming Saints \u2014 6-foot-6 Shawn Walker, 6-foot-8 Luke Sutherland and 6-foot-10 Kyle Young \u2014 should help Siena address that issue.</p>, <p>\u201cI love size. Here, I think I can get size and athleticism,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to be able to [press] better down the road, but we need to do a good job with it right now, too.\u201d</p>, <p>When Christian coached at Mount St. Mary\u2019s for six seasons, he often had to choose between athleticism and size when bringing in a player. Routinely, he took on long-term projects in need of serious development \u2014 and if a player\u2019s potential was realized, he often soon transferred to a stronger league than the Northeast Conference, which is simply part of life for NEC coaches.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, at Siena, Christian expressed confidence within his first few weeks on the job that he could attract \u201chigh-level transfers.\u201d That confidence has already been rewarded, as Siena added redshirt junior Elijah Burns \u2014 a Troy native who started his college career at Notre Dame \u2014 to its program earlier this season. With a smile, Christian said last month he wasn\u2019t surprised his coaching staff was able to bring an ACC-level talent into the fold during its first season at Siena.</p>, <p>\u201cI never believe in setting any limits,\u201d said Christian, whose program is still waiting to find out if Burns will be declared eligible to play the rest of this season.</p>, <p>And despite Siena sitting three games below .500 and the <a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/12/20/limitations-show-in-siena-men-s-basketball-loss">limitations of this season\u2019s roster</a>, there is little reason to put a cap on this season\u2019s potential for the Saints within MAAC play. In the 11-team league, seven teams registered between three and five wins during the non-conference season \u2014 and only one program, Niagara, heads into MAAC play with a winning record. All that is certain about Siena\u2019s future is that the last-place prediction MAAC coaches placed upon the Saints before the season started will only be met if Siena underperforms during the next couple months, which Christian\u2019s squad heads into off its best team performance of the season and with a pair of its players \u2014 senior Evan Fisher and freshman Jalen Pickett \u2014 reigning as the league\u2019s top player and rookie of the week.</p>, <p>The future remains a bright one for Siena, but the immediate future appears brighter than was expected months ago.</p>, <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a chance to be pretty special,\u201d said Christian, whose Mount St. Mary\u2019s teams went a combined 67-39 in league play. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just got to continue to grow.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Reach Michael Kelly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2845434d444451684c494144514f49524d5c5c4d06464d5c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e68b8d838a8a9fa682878f8a9f81879c83929283c8888392">[email\xa0protected]</span></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ByMichaelKelly">@ByMichaelKelly</a> on Twitter.</em></p>]

The Buffalo captain, who sustained the injury in the first period of a 3-1 loss to the New York Islanders on Monday, will be re-evaluated next week.</p>, <p>"Obviously, Jack's a big part of our team," Sabres coach Phil Housley said. "It's a day-to-day situation, which is really encouraging. But we want to be cautious with it as well. There's a lot of hockey to be played."</p>, <p>Eichel, named to the NHL All-Star Game on Wednesday, leads Buffalo with 49 points (15 goals, 34 assists) in 40 games this season. He has 30 points (11 goals, 19 assists) in the 23 games since his line with <span class="token token-playerCard" id="token-475C61E09E67048049C83">Jeff Skinner</span> and <span class="token token-playerCard" id="token-E29502A399FF12689A285">Sam Reinhart</span> first began playing together Nov. 13. The Sabres have gone 12-7-4 during that stretch; at least one of the three has scored in all but four of those games.</p>, <p>"There's an opportunity there," Skinner said. "Everyone in here plays in the NHL so it's a good challenge for us. Obviously, it's a big hole to fill but we're going to try to fill it by committee."</p>, <p>Forward <span class="token token-playerCard" id="token-76B53D0EC4D11E6398785">Evan Rodrigues</span> will get the first crack at filling in on the top line. A Boston University alumnus like Eichel, he knows he doesn't have to change much on his end.</p>, <p>"They're two highly skilled players who have had a great season so far," Rodrigues said of Skinner and Reinhart. "I'm just going to play my game, let them play theirs and just try to get them the puck as much as possible."</p>, <p>Housley rotated the top center spot after Eichel left the game Monday. Rodrigues' versatility earned him the chance to get the call against the Panthers.</p>, <p>Rodrigues has 11 points (two goals, nine assists) in 34 games this season.</p>, <p>"[Rodrigues] has been used in a lot of different capacities -- power play, penalty kill, moving up and down the lineup. That's what he brings to our team," Housley said. "The next stage is just his contributions offensively and trying to finish and go to the net hard. He's doing all the right things right now. Hopefully that translates into production."</p>, <p class="modal-share-text"></p>, <p class="btm-nhl-announcement-modal__body text--sans-serif-display">\n                    The NHL uses cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.

However, the Rockets have completely turned things around, and they're doing it with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/555969/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> out of the lineup.

Harden is playing the best basketball of his NBA career, and that's really saying something considering he's coming off an MVP Award. Over the past five games, he's averaging 41.8 points and shooting 41.5 percent from beyond the arc. If the Rockets want to top the defending champions, they're going to need another stellar effort from Harden.</p>, <p><strong>Warriors</strong>: It's been an up-and-down season for the Warriors to say the least. However, one of the biggest issues has been the shooting struggles of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1647559/klay-thompson">Klay Thompson</a> to this point. Thompson is currently averaging 21.0 points while shooting 34.4 percent from beyond the arc.

[<p class="article-summary"></p>, <p><p>If you and your buddies roll the ball in the fairway, take a mulligan per side, give each other 6-foot downhill putts and have only a casual acquaintance with lateral hazards vs. out-of-bounds shots, there\u2019s probably not much you need to know about the changes to the Rules of Golf for 2019.</p><p>Then again, some of the stuff you\u2019ve been getting away with in your circle of friends might now be permissible \u2014 so read on.</p><p>When Jan. 1, 2019 dawned, it was a new era in golf for those who play by the strict rules. The big news is that the word strict has a new meaning.</p><p>\u201cThe rules are more player-friendly,\u201d said Tom Dudley, a Jacksonville resident and veteran United States Golf Association rules official.</p><p>Do you have a 20-foot downhill putt from the back of the green to a front pin? You can leave the flag in the hole to take some of the sting out if the ball kisses the stick.</p><p>Did you accidentally hit the ball while taking practice putting strokes? It won\u2019t cost you as dearly as before.</p><p>Were you afraid that taking a drop in the rough would result in a lie buried under several inches of Bermuda grass? That drop, required from arm\u2019s length in the past, is now a matter of a few inches.</p><p>On the other hand, you get two minutes less to find a lost ball. But your playing partners will love it.</p><p>Those are just some of the changes to the rules of golf that took effect at the stroke of midnight of the new year.</p><p>The USGA and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which jointly administer the rules, made the most sweeping changes to how the game is conducted since eliminating stymies. The intent is to make the rules less complicated and archaic, so as to not drive away players \u2014 bad for business.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the USGA and R&amp;A go more with a more common-sense approach to the rules,\u201d said Deerwood Country Club director of golf and Northern Chapter PGA president Tim Cooper. \u201cThey seem to have decided that just because a rule has always been this way is not sufficient reason to mean it has to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>Many of the rules also have to do with reducing the amount of time it takes to play a round of golf \u2014 one of the most frequent reasons players who leave the game cite.</p><p>For starters, the number of rules has been reduced from 34 to 24. There are sections and sub-paragraphs in all of them but the current Rules of Golf book has only 180 pages devoted to the rules.</p><p>The purists aren\u2019t all that happy and wonder why golf has to be dumbed down. But from an economic standpoint, golf can\u2019t survive being played only by the purists.</p><p>Those who want to peruse the changes in detail need only visit usga.org.

You can also touch the ground or water in a hazard but still cannot ground the club behind the ball in a bunker.</p><p>\u2022 Players can actually avoid hitting out of bunkers at any time. They are allowed to drop outside bunkers, on a line between their ball and the green, no closer to the hole, with a two-stroke penalty.</p><p>\u2022 Only two modifications make current rules tougher. If you\u2019ve lost your ball, you get three minutes to find it, not five. Also, caddies cannot stand behind players and line them up for their shots.</p><p>Cooper said chatter from his members indicate their favorite changes are being able to remove debris from bunkers and hazards, drops from knee height and the reduced time being able to look for lost balls.</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves that new rule, except for the guy who lost the ball,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut they have studies that have shown that if you don\u2019t find the ball in three minutes, you\u2019re probably not going to find it within the additional two minutes.\u201d\xa0</p></p>, <p>If you and your buddies roll the ball in the fairway, take a mulligan per side, give each other 6-foot downhill putts and have only a casual acquaintance with lateral hazards vs. out-of-bounds shots, there\u2019s probably not much you need to know about the changes to the Rules of Golf for 2019.</p>, <p>Then again, some of the stuff you\u2019ve been getting away with in your circle of friends might now be permissible \u2014 so read on.</p>, <p>When Jan. 1, 2019 dawned, it was a new era in golf for those who play by the strict rules. The big news is that the word strict has a new meaning.</p>, <p>\u201cThe rules are more player-friendly,\u201d said Tom Dudley, a Jacksonville resident and veteran United States Golf Association rules official.</p>, <p>Do you have a 20-foot downhill putt from the back of the green to a front pin? You can leave the flag in the hole to take some of the sting out if the ball kisses the stick.</p>, <p>Did you accidentally hit the ball while taking practice putting strokes? It won\u2019t cost you as dearly as before.</p>, <p>Were you afraid that taking a drop in the rough would result in a lie buried under several inches of Bermuda grass? That drop, required from arm\u2019s length in the past, is now a matter of a few inches.</p>, <p>On the other hand, you get two minutes less to find a lost ball. But your playing partners will love it.</p>, <p>Those are just some of the changes to the rules of golf that took effect at the stroke of midnight of the new year.</p>, <p>The USGA and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which jointly administer the rules, made the most sweeping changes to how the game is conducted since eliminating stymies. The intent is to make the rules less complicated and archaic, so as to not drive away players \u2014 bad for business.</p>, <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the USGA and R&amp;A go more with a more common-sense approach to the rules,\u201d said Deerwood Country Club director of golf and Northern Chapter PGA president Tim Cooper. \u201cThey seem to have decided that just because a rule has always been this way is not sufficient reason to mean it has to stay that way.\u201d</p>, <p>Many of the rules also have to do with reducing the amount of time it takes to play a round of golf \u2014 one of the most frequent reasons players who leave the game cite.</p>, <p>For starters, the number of rules has been reduced from 34 to 24. There are sections and sub-paragraphs in all of them but the current Rules of Golf book has only 180 pages devoted to the rules.</p>, <p>The purists aren\u2019t all that happy and wonder why golf has to be dumbed down. But from an economic standpoint, golf can\u2019t survive being played only by the purists.</p>, <p>Those who want to peruse the changes in detail need only visit usga.org. But here are the highlights:</p>, <p>\u2022 Players are allowed to putt with the flagstick in the hole. No need to have a playing partner tend the flag, which will save time.</p>, <p>"I think a lot of handicap players will like this rule," Cooper said.</p>, <p>The pros are already in different camps as far as leaving the flag in the hole.</p>, <p>Bryson DeChambeau has said he will leave the pin in, even on short putts.

Rice will look to earn a much-needed home victory after losing seven of its last nine games, while Southern Miss enters Thursday's Conference USA matchup having lost three of its last four. The latest Southern Miss vs. Rice odds have the Golden Eagles favored by 6.5 points, while the over-under, or total points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 142. Before you make any Southern Miss vs. Rice picks and college basketball predictions, you'll want to see what SportsLine's advanced computer model has to say.\xa0</p>, <p>This model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has raked in the winnings for those following its picks. Over the past two years, the SportsLine Projection Model has returned over $5,200 to $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks. And it enters Week 9 of the 2018-19 college basketball season on a blistering 32-14 run on its top-rated college basketball picks against the spread. Anybody who has been following it is way, way up.</p>, <p>Now it's locked in on Southern Miss vs. Rice. We can tell you it's leaning over, but it's also locked in a confident against the spread pick that hits in nearly 60 percent of simulations. You can only see that one at SportsLine.\xa0</p>, <p>The model knows Rice boasts a high flying offense that features three players averaging over 12 points per game. The Owls are loaded with upperclassmen like junior forward <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/players/playerpage/2268423/robert-martin">Robert Martin</a>, who's averaging 13.2 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, but it's freshman guard <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/players/playerpage/3042488/chris-mullins">Chris Mullins</a> who has been filling the stat sheet as of late. In fact, Mullins is averaging over 18 points per game in his last five outings.</p>, <p>But just because the Owls have found an explosive playmaker in Mullins doesn't mean they can stay within the 6.5-point spread against Southern Miss.\xa0</p>, <p>Despite their recent losing skid, the Golden Eagles also have an explosive playmaker who can take over a game. Senior guard <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/players/playerpage/2203290/cortez-edwards">Cortez Edwards</a> enters Thursday's matchup averaging 14.2 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.4 assists this season.

A total of 34 of the 37 golfers who won a PGA event last season will tee it up at this week's event, which gets underway on Thursday at Kapalua Plantation Course in Hawaii. The Sentry Tournament of Champions tee times begin at 3 p.m. ET with Satoshi Kodaira and Cameron Champ heading to the first hole. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, who tees at 5:40 p.m. ET, is the Vegas favorite at 5-1, while Jon Rahm is a close second at 7-1 in the latest 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions odds. 2016 champion Justin Thomas and World No. 1 Brooks Koepka are going off at 8-1. Before locking in any 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions picks and predictions or entering any PGA DFS tournament on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, be sure to check out the predictions and projected leaderboard from the team at SportsLine. </p>, <p>SportsLine's prediction model, which was built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has nailed four of the past eight majors entering the weekend and called Woods' deep run in the PGA Championship despite being a 25-1 long shot.\xa0</p>, <p>The proprietary computer model has been dead-on early in the 2018-19 PGA season as well. It was all over Jon Rahm (12-1) at the 2018 Hero World Challenge, projecting him as a top contender from the start. It also correctly predicted Brooks Koepka's (9-1) victory at the 2018 CJ Cup earlier this season. Anyone who has followed the model is up huge.\xa0</p>, <p>Now that the 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions field is locked, SportsLine simulated the event 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. One huge shocker the model is calling for this week: Johnson, the 5-1 favorite to win this event, fails in his bid to repeat.\xa0</p>, <p>Thus far in the 2018-19 PGA season, Johnson finished 30th in the WGC-HSBC Champions event in October and then took seventh in the Hero World Challenge, an unofficial event. Although he won this event last year, he's taken down just two tournaments on tour since that point and had just one top-five finish in his final five events last season. There are far better values to be had in this loaded Sentry Tournament of Champions 2019 field.\xa0</p>, <p>Another surprise: Cameron Champ, a 20-1 long shot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.\xa0</p>, <p>Champ enters 2019 playing as well as any golfer on the PGA Tour. He earned his first career PGA Tour victory earlier this season at the Sanderson Farms Championship after shooting four consecutive rounds under par. He also finished inside the top 10 at the Mayakoba Golf Classic and RSM Classic.\xa0</p>, <p>Champ is a long ball hitter who averages over 328 yards per drive, which is tops on the PGA Tour. His ability to drive the ball deep into the fairway allows him to use his short irons to approach the green. That lethal combination has allowed Champ to rank inside the top 10 in both birdie average (5.85) and scoring average (68.968) this season. He can make up ground in a hurry and should be on your radar at the Sentry Tournament of Champions 2019.</p>, <p>Also, the model says four additional golfers with odds of 12-1 or longer make a strong run at the title. Anyone who bets on these underdogs could hit it big.\xa0</p>, <p><strong>So who wins the 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions? And which long shots stun the golfing world?

[<p><strong>The four Boston first rounder could be more valuable than originally imagined</strong></p>, <p>As it stands right now the Boston Celtics would have four first round picks in the 2019 NBA Draft. They will likely have the Memphis Grizzlies first round pick, the Sacramento Kings first rounder, the Los Angeles Clippers first rounder, and their own. While the Grizzlies, Kings and Clippers are all performing above expectations these picks will still be extremely valuable in the coming months.</p>, <p>There is the very <a href="https://aroyalpain.com/2019/01/03/the-sacramento-kings-are-for-real-and-all-business/" target="_blank">real chance that the Kings</a> and Grizzlies will both again wind up in the lottery. Both teams would miss the Western Conference playoffs if the postseason started today despite both teams owning a .500 record, which is usually good enough to get you into the dance. Having two lottery picks has increased importance this year as the NBA is changing its lottery format for the first time in years. The Kings and Grizzlies are likely to finish with somewhere around the sixth to 14<sup>th</sup> worst records in the NBA. Under the old rules, teams in those slots would have virtually no shot at obtaining at top three pick.

We've had guys also step up and make timely baskets, and different people have stepped up at the end of the games. There's a lot of that good, blue-collar togetherness that has sort of been a part of what we've done.\u201d</p>, <p class="p-text">Miller wasn\u2019t defending IU\u2019s resume so much as explaining what his team got out of a difficult November and December, which didn\u2019t come without some lows.</p>, <p class="p-text">There were the last-second loss to Arkansas, the humbling defeat at Duke and those injuries, which appear to be as much of a concern in 2019 as they were in 2018.</p>, <p class="p-text">Miller said Wednesday during his first media briefing of the new year that redshirt senior guard Zach McRoberts could return from the back problem that held him out of the end of nonconference play. But freshman point guard Robert Phinisee is still in concussion protocol and hasn\u2019t practiced, with Miller saying IU will \u201cplan to move forward without him here for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p class="p-text">Long-term injury concerns Jerome Hunter (lower-body) and Race Thompson (concussion) likewise appear no closer to a conclusion.</p>, <p class="p-text">Those absences have opened doors for other Hoosiers. They\u2019ve handed freshman Damezi Anderson a bench role. Sophomore Al Durham has become a fixture in the starting lineup and among IU\u2019s ball handlers. And Devonte Green, who ended last season as Indiana\u2019s No. 1 point guard before beginning this one sidelined by his own injury, has begun to find his old form. He was the most recent recipient of IU\u2019s gold jersey, given to an outstanding practice performer.</p>, <p class="p-text">\u201cHe's done a nice job in practice leading into our last three wins. He's been a big, big part of our practices in term of him reengaging and being a primary player,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAs a coach, you worry about everything, but as a player, I think you see opportunity and you feel good that you're going to have a chance to contribute and be a part of this thing. I think that's pretty much what our guys have done (through injury problems). That's always how we have approached it, next man up, so to speak, and continue to work to get better and create an opportunity to change the path of your own individual season.\u201d</p>, <p>Indiana Hoosiers guard Devonte Green (11) is regaining his stride; here shooting against Jacksonville at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Ind., on Dec. 22, 2018.<meta content="Bobby Goddin/For IndyStar" itemprop="copyrightHolder"/>\xa0<span class="credit">(Photo: Bobby Goddin/For IndyStar)</span></p>, <p class="p-text">None of that will automatically make January easier, much less successful.</p>, <p class="p-text">After the Illini leave Bloomington, IU must prepare for a weekend trip to conference frontrunner Michigan, then travel to Maryland at the end of next week. In total, the Hoosiers have to visit Michigan, Maryland, Michigan State and Purdue by Feb. 2, and their only two home games this month, after Illinois, are against the Wolverines and Nebraska.</p>, <p class="p-text">Ultimately, anyone wanting further evidence of this team\u2019s Big Ten and postseason credentials is about to get a heaping pile of it.</p>, <p class="p-text">The next month has the capacity to make or break Miller\u2019s team, and his second season in charge. The Big Ten is as strong as it\u2019s been in at least five years, maybe longer, and it\u2019s not prepared to wait for a young Indiana team to get back to 100 percent. It will also present the Hoosiers with chance after chance for resume-boosting wins, with this team already tight-game tested.</p>, <p class="p-text">\u201cWinning close games like that just builds toughness moving forward, being in those situations,\u201d grad transfer forward Evan Fitzner said. \u201cJust to have that experience moving forward will help us down the road in Big Ten and then hopefully in March.\u201d</p>, <p class="p-text">It will be March that matters most to this team, but January and February that decide whether it\u2019s worthy. Hanging onto at least some reservations about this group in the meantime is understandable.

[<p>Even one of the nation's leading scorers knows it takes a team effort to knock off the No. 2 team in the nation.</p>, <p>The No. 18 Dakota Wesleyan University men's basketball team edged No. 2 Morningside College 86-82 in a Great Plains Athletic Conference men's basketball game on Wednesday at the Corn Palace.</p>, <p>DWU guard Ty Hoglund, who is the fifth leading scorer in the nation, pumped in 30 points and hit clutch shots late to bury the Mustangs. But Hoglund had plenty of help in handing Morningside College (14-1, 8-1) its first loss of the season.</p>, <p>"Not one guy can just beat that team," Hoglund said. "We had to have six-seven guys step up and that's what we did tonight."</p>, <p>The Tigers (13-4, 7-3 GPAC) used a second-half surge to put away the Mustangs, who entered the contest as the one of two undefeated teams in NAIA Division II.</p>, <p>"I thought it was a big-boy basketball game and I thought we had big performances all over the court," DWU coach Matt Wilber said. "That's a team basketball win and we were competing down the stretch."</p>, <p>DWU broke away from a 44-43 halftime advantage and built a 78-68 lead on a Hoglund 3-point play. The Mustangs took advantage of some missed shots by the Tigers and chopped the deficit to 80-76 with 1:30 left. Hoglund gave DWU some breathing room with a 3-pointer to make it 83-76 with 51 ticks left and it got the 2,531 fans at the Corn Palace rocking again.</p>, <p>"It's what I dreamt of as a kid, hitting a shot and the crowd goes crazy," Hoglund said. "Playing at the Corn Palace, there's nothing better. We have the best fans in the country. There's no doubt about that."</p>, <p>The Tigers converted at the free-throw line in the closing seconds to cap the victory.</p>, <p>Brody Egger scored 20 points for the Mustangs, while big man Tyler Borchers added 15 points and nine rebounds.</p>, <p>Nick Harden added 13 points and Aaron Ahmadu scored 12 points for the Tigers. Both teams battled foul trouble and the Tigers had a host of reserves make an impact.</p>, <p>"We had guys coming off the bench that were just constantly coming and contributing," DWU reserve post Tristan Teichmeier said. "This is the best overall game we played yet. It's just a great team win."</p>, <p>Teichmeier played 21 minutes as starter Sam McCloud was saddled with foul trouble and played 19 minutes, finishing with nine points. Teichmeier responded with 11 points (seven in the second half) and seven rebounds.</p>, <p>"I just was so encouraged and so happy for him because he's been dying to be productive for us and he's starting to be that way for us and good for him," Wilber said.</p>, <p>The 6-foot-6 Teichmeier drew the assignment of guarding the 6-foot-7 Borchers, who briefly left the game with a cut above his eye and returned with a bandage wrapped around his head.</p>, <p>"I have waited a long time to be able to play the game and I accepted it," Teichmeier said. "Wilber told me he's a big dude and he's big. I am not going to lie, but I was ready for it."</p>, <p>Mason Larson finished with four big rebounds and two steals. He hit just one of his four 3-point attempts, but it snapped a mini-Morningside run to stretch the lead back to 66-62 with 8:52 left.</p>, <p>"I know he missed a few shots, but he banged a big one and he's competing out there," Wilber said.</p>, <p>The action was back and forth in the opening minutes, with 10 lead changes in the first 6 1/2 minutes. The Mustangs pulled away and built an eight-point lead (24-16) with 10:48 left.</p>, <p>The Tigers weathered foul trouble and closed the first half with Teichmeier, Larson, Ahmadu, Cooper Williams and Collin Kramer. Ahmadu nailed a buzzer beater in the lane to make it 44-43 at halftime.</p>, <p>The teams traded shots in the early part of the second half before DWU pulled ahead.</p>, <p>"Everything about this was a team basketball win and that's who we are here," Wilber said. "We talk and preached about it. (It's) our culture and winning together and that's what these guys did."</p>, <p>The Tigers play at Dordt College on Wednesday, Jan. 9.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>No. 18 Dakota Wesleyan 86, No. 2 Morningside 82</strong></p>, <p><strong>Dakota Wesleyan (13-4, 7-3):</strong> Ty Hoglund 10-17 5-6 30, Nick Harden 5-10 3-6 13, Aaron Ahmadu 5-9 1-2 12, Tristan Teichmeier 4-7 3-7 11, Samuel McCloud 3-6 0-0 9, Mason Larson 1-4 0-0 3, Koln Oppold 0-4 0-0 0, Cooper Williams 0-1 0-0 0.

[<p class="label">\n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t</p>, <p>For the second time in less than a year, former San Francisco 49ers linebacker Reuben Foster has seen domestic violence charges against him dropped, TMZ Sports reported Thursday.</p>, <p>Foster\u2019s attorney Eddie Suarez said he believed the charges, related to a Nov. 24 incident at the 49ers team hotel in Tampa, were dropped due to \u201cissues with the witness\u2019 credibility,\u201d according to TMZ. Foster was scheduled for arraignment Thursday in Hillsborough County in Florida, but the hearing was canceled after prosecutors reportedly dropped the case.</p>, <p>Neither the\xa0Hillsborough County State Attorney\u2019s Office nor Suarez could be reached for comment by this news organization Thursday.</p>, <p>Shortly after Foster and estranged girlfriend Elissa Ennis got into the Nov. 24 altercation at the 49ers team hotel, Foster was <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/25/49ers-release-reuben-foster-after-latest-domestic-violence-arrest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arrested and released by the 49ers</a>.\xa0Ennis soon after appeared on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d where\xa0 she detailed the hotel encounter and\xa0<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/06/reuben-fosters-accuser-breaks-silence-on-ex-49ers-alleged-domestic-violence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">retracted her recantation in the Los Gatos case</a>.</p>, <p>It was the second time in the past 12 months that Foster was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, with the\xa0<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/02/12/reuben-foster-arrest-girlfriend-alleges-49ers-player-dragged-her-during-argument-sources-say/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first occurring at their Los Gatos</a>\xa0home in February. Two felony domestic-violence related charges in that case were <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/23/judge-to-decide-today-whether-reuben-foster-goes-to-trial/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismissed by a judge in May</a> when Ennis recanted the story she had told police. A third charge, for assault-rifle possession, was downgraded to a misdemeanor; Foster <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/06/49ers-reuben-foster-pleads-no-contest-to-assault-rifle-charge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pleaded no contest and was sentenced to probation</a>.</p>, <p>Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said after the Tampa arrest that his office was waiting for prosecutors there to complete their case before pursuing any legal options, including <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/06/reuben-fosters-accuser-breaks-silence-on-ex-49ers-alleged-domestic-violence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">whether to pursue a probation violation</a> for Foster. He also stated that Ennis will face no perjury charges stemming from the TV interview where she confessed to lying on the stand to protect Foster.</p>, <p>Thursday, Rosen\u2019s office issued a statement reiterating that prosecutors are still evaluating the Foster situation.</p>, <p>\u201cMr. Foster remains on probation for his misdemeanor conviction in Santa Clara County,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWould a court in Santa Clara County, California consider an allegation that did not result in a criminal charge in another state to be a basis for a violation of his court probation condition to obey all laws? We are looking into it.\u201d</p>, <p>The 49ers declined to comment after the news that the Florida charges were dropped against Foster. But after the organization cut him from the team, General Manager John Lynch said,\xa0\u201cI was very direct with him, that if he didn\u2019t prove to us that we could trust how he made decisions it didn\u2019t matter whether he was right or wrong \u2026 That\u2019s the consequences of life. If you put yourself in those situations, that\u2019s not OK with us.\u201d</p>, <p>Also after the Florida arrest, news surfaced that Foster and Ennis were the subject of a <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/11/santa-clara-city-re-releases-video-of-reuben-foster-domestic-call-with-unredacted-audio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">domestic-violence call at an apartment in Santa Clara in October,</a> but one was arrested after police said they found no evidence of a crime. But they told police that they lived together, indicating that they reconciled after the Los Gatos case was dismissed.</p>, <p>On \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Ennis described how she had reconnected with Foster and how his latest arrest unfolded.</p>, <p>\u201cHe called me to come see him in Florida,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I came and he took one of my phones and he slapped me and pushed me. I told him I was going to tell his new girlfriend that he paid for my flight out there, so that\u2019s what triggered it.</p>, <p>\u201cHe called me out there so we could work on our relationship. And so I was, \u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d be back to doing this because we both were seeing therapists.\u2019 \u201d</p>, <p>Within days of being released by the 49ers, Foster was <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/27/which-nfl-team-claimed-reuben-foster-off-waivers-from-49ers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">picked up by Washington</a>. The team was criticized, and said Foster would not suit up for them until the legal process was resolved.</p>, <p class="prompt">Get Morning Report and other email newsletters</p>]

[<p>Liberty\u2019s coaching staff sent out the wrong wrestler at 145 pounds.</p>, <p>All freshman Christian Reid did in his first varsity match was cover for the coaches by delivering an improbable pin.</p>, <p>\u201cIt was a rookie coaching mistake,\u201d Hurricanes coach Jody Karam said. \u201cWe made a serious mistake. The wrong kid went out. It was too late to bring him back. As a head coach, I accept full responsibility for it.</p>, <p>\u201cBut, nothing went as scripted tonight.\u201d</p>, <p>Making Reid\u2019s win more impressive \u2014 and important \u2014 was that he was losing 7-1 midway through the third period before getting the reverse and headlock to secure the six points in 5 minutes, 22 seconds.</p>, <p>There were other heroes for Liberty during Wednesday\u2019s 32-28 EPC win over host Northampton.</p>, <p>With the home side of Pete Schneider Gym going crazy after Jayden Bortz beat Damen Moyer 7-6 at 195 pounds to give the Konkrete Kids a 28-17 lead, Jake Ahmad needed 40 seconds to give the Hurricanes the momentum back.</p>, <p>Jaden Freeman made sure Liberty didn\u2019t let it go. The senior 285-pounder secured a takedown in the last two seconds to win 4-3.</p>, <p>Connor Werner scored a takedown halfway through the first period, then took advantage of a mistake with 40 seconds left at 106 and turned it into a five-point move and a 7-0 win.</p>, <p>That left hammer Tal-Reese Flemming, a returning state bronze medalist, to clinch the match.</p>, <p>The senior 113-pounder got an early takedown, but then was ridden out for the second period and most of the third before getting a reversal with four seconds left to give Liberty the win.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is what makes Lehigh Valley wrestling fun,\u201d Karam said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pay for what we got tonight.</p>, <p>\u201cNothing buys you this feeling. Christian Reid, man, losing the match, and typical Liberty guts. And, [Connor] Werner with the big win and Jake Ahmad, those three guys really turned it around for us.\u201d</p>, <p>For the Konkrete Kids, it was an opportunity missed.</p>, <p>\u201cFor a little while there, we felt like we had them right where we needed them,\u201d Northampton coach Seth Lisa said.</p>, <p>\u201cWe knew some type of shift was going to happen, able to get matchup we wanted at 145, up 7-1 going for major, get pinned in a headlock. Not beating a team as good as Liberty when your guys are losing bouts like that.</p>, <p>\u201cAt heavyweight, you\u2019re beating a really good kid, then get taken down with no time on clock. That cost us the match.</p>, <p>\u201cAt 106, we tried a silly move you thought was going to help you score. You have to understand the sport to realize the basics win the match.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe got a lot to learn from this. \u2026 We\u2019re most certainly going to wrestle them again. This was a trial run. \u201d</p>, <p>After losing the opener, Northampton won five of six bouts, all with bonus points, to build a 25-10 lead.</p>, <p>Bortz then pulled off the upset of Moyer, who had pinned him twice in previous matches. It didn\u2019t come easy, though.

[<p>BROSSARD - The new year began with some good news as <span class="token token-playerCard" id="token-028E553928003317ECE9A">Carey Price</span> and <span class="token token-playerCard" id="token-BD76523206C3FFE718CBD">Joel Armia</span> might just be in uniform against the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday night at the Bell Centre.</p>, <p>Price took part in his first practice with the team since sustaining an injury that forced him to miss the final three games of the Canadiens' extended six-game road trip.</p>, <p>The goaltender was unable to confirm that he'd be in between the pipes versus Vancouver, though.</p>, <p>"I'll see how things go on Thursday. We'll see how I recover tonight. If everything goes well, I should be able to play," explained Price.</p>, <p>The Canadiens' No. 31 also indicated that he's been dealing with this injury for a while.</p>, <p>"I've been playing with the injury for around seven weeks," mentioned Price.</p>, <p>For his part, head coach Claude Julien plans on taking the same approach as Price when it comes to determining whether his starter will be back at work in the Habs' first game of 2019.</p>, <p>"I'll wait until Thursday.

[<p id="weatherChange"></p>, <p class="byline ap-byline">Rhiannon Potkey, Associated Press</p>, <p class="open">Caption</p>, <p class="close">Close</p>, <p>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee head coach Holly Warlick wants to see her young team mature into productive college players.</p>, <p>But as she watched Belmont continually drive to the basket and beat the Lady Vols on backdoor cuts, Warlick wanted to put her players in a fundamental time machine.</p>, <p>"Go back to elementary school - the ball, you and the basket," Warlick said. "Stay between the ball and the basket and forget about what happened on the other end. You have to have a short-term memory when you make a mistake."</p>, <p>Evina Westbrook scored 20 points and sparked a late flurry as the No. 10 Lady Vols held off Belmont 84-76 on Sunday in their final tune-up before Southeastern Conference play begins.</p>, <p>Rennia Davis scored 19 points and Meme Jackson and Zaay Green each had 10 for Tennessee, which received a wake-up call on defense in the second half against the gritty Bruins.</p>, <p>Belmont (7-4), a perennial mid-major contender, gave the Lady Vols (11-1) all they could handle, rallying from an 18-point first-half deficit to take a brief lead in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p>But Tennessee managed to hit enough shots down the stretch to avoid the upset in the first meeting between the in-state programs since 1979.</p>, <p>Ellie Harmeyer finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds for Belmont, which outscored Tennessee 50-34 in the paint. Darby Maggard finished with 14 points, Maura Muensterman had 12 and Maddie Wright scored 10.</p>, <p>Belmont entered the game averaging 10 made 3-pointers per game to rank No. 11 in the nation. The Lady Vols focused on running them off the 3-point line, and it worked. The Bruins finished only 4 of 20 from behind the arc while Tennessee was hot from outside early.</p>, <p>The Lady Vols had never hit seven or more 3-pointers in five straight games, but easily reached that milestone by halftime.</p>, <p>Tennessee finished 9 of 13 from deep through two quarters to enter the break with a seemingly comfortable 51-35 advantage.</p>, <p>But the Lady Vols would go cold from deep, failing to hit another 3-pointer for the remainder of the game.</p>, <p>Belmont went inside to stage its comeback, pushing around the Lady Vols near the rim and out-hustling them for loose balls. The Bruins outscored Tennessee 23-8 in the third quarter to trim the deficit to 59-58.</p>, <p>Maggard gave the Bruins their first lead since early in the first quarter with a layup for a 64-63 edge with 6:12 remaining.</p>, <p>"They chose to play small for a lot of stretches there in the second half, so we were able to get some stuff to Ellie and Maddie inside on post ups," Belmont head coach Bart Brooks said. "But most of our inside stuff was back cuts and dribble drives and floor spacing. We expected that because of how they pressured the ball."</p>, <p>The teams traded baskets in the fourth quarter before Westbrook helped spark a late run for the Lady Vols to remain in front for good.</p>, <p>BIG PICTURE</p>, <p>Belmont: The Ohio Valley Conference favorites played a challenging pre-conference schedule to prepare for their title defense. The Bruins faced three Power 5 conference teams, including two ranked in the AP Top 25 - No. 9 North Carolina State and No. 10 Tennessee. Belmont has yet to beat a ranked opponent since transitioning to Division I in 1997, falling to 0-20 all-time. But the second-half performance against the Lady Vols gives the Bruins some confidence.</p>, <p>"We came in here ready to win," Maggard said. "Honestly, it is really encouraging. We are going to take this game and learn more from it and keep moving forward. I think playing teams like this is only going to help us in our conference and down the road when we are hopefully in big-time games in March."</p>, <p>Tennessee: With six freshmen and sophomores playing more than 13 minutes per game, the youthful Lady Vols have to be happy with their record entering conference play. But they have to be concerned with how easily Belmont pushed them around inside in the second half as they prepare for the rigors of the SEC. Tennessee's only loss came to No. 6 Stanford, and they beat No. 13 Texas on the road.</p>, <p>ALL THAT JAZZ</p>, <p>Tennessee freshman guard Jazmine Massengill scored seven points and grabbed five rebounds for the Lady Vols, one game after recording a career-high 10 points against Murray State. The Lady Vols have been encouraging Massengill to look for her shot more when she's open to help keep defenses honest.</p>, <p>"It is amazing. I had a talk with her before I came in here and said, 'Great game. You just have to be consistent and keep shooting the ball,'" Westbrook said.</p>, <p>HISTORY LESSON</p>, <p>Warlick was a point guard leading Pat Summitt's team the last time these programs met in 1979. Warlick scored 15 points in a 94-53 win over the Bruins in the first round of the Tennessee College Women's Sports Federation Tournament at Stokely Athletics Center in Knoxville.</p>, <p>UP NEXT</p>, <p>Belmont opens Ohio Valley Conference play against Jacksonville State on Thursday at home.</p>, <p>Tennessee opens Southeastern Conference play against Auburn on Thursday on the road.</p>]

He has been there since being transferred from a hospital in September 2014.</p>, <p>"You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him," Schumacher's family said in a rare statement Wednesday. "Please understand if we are following Michael's wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy."</p>, <p>It was while skiing with his teenage son Mick in the French Alps at Meribel that Schumacher fell on Dec. 29, 2013. He hit the right side of his head on a rock, splitting open his helmet. Doctors at Grenoble hospital removed blood clots, but others were left untouched because too deeply embedded in his brain.</p>, <p>Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year!  Act now!</p>, <p>#ReadLocal</p>, <p>With unsourced stories abounding, updates on his condition went from scarce to non-existent as his family closed ranks around him . But the family understands the level of devotion toward Schumacher from his legions of fans.</p>, <p>Coinciding with his birthday, the family is releasing the Official Michael Schumacher App offering a virtual museum tour of his greatest achievements.</p>, <p>"The app is another milestone in our effort to do justice to him and you, his fans, by celebrating his accomplishments," the statement said.</p>, <p>Many of those accomplishments were with Ferrari, where the German driving ace won five titles. The Italian manufacturer is honoring his 50th with a special museum exhibition of his achievements at its Maranello headquarters in northern Italy.</p>, <p>His stature is Ferrari folklore is immense, while his impact on F1 is unparalleled with perhaps the exception of the late Brazilian great Ayrton Senna.</p>, <p>Schumacher's winners' aura was perhaps unfairly viewed from the outside as cold and distant, when in essence he was incredibly appreciative of those he worked closely with. In 2000, he delivered Ferrari from years of frustration with a first world title since Jody Scheckter in 1979.</p>, <p>At the time, Schumacher spoke about the emotions he felt as the team celebrated wildly around him.</p>, <p>"Those faces. Bright eyes everywhere and everyone cheering," Schumacher said in recognition. "I would have loved to hug and kiss each and every one of them."</p>, <p>Schumacher won the next four F1 titles \u2014 even securing the 2002 title an astonishing six races before the end \u2014 on his way to a record 91 GP wins. His speed, consistency and work ethic were all unmatched.</p>, <p>"He was winning races sometimes he shouldn't have won," said F1's managing director Ross Brawn, who worked with Schumacher on all seven F1 titles. "He just had a majesty about him in that period."</p>, <p>During Schumacher's glory years, F1 even rivalled soccer as the No. 1 sport in Italy \u2014 quite an achievement. Memorabilia from those halcyon days, including cars and race-worn helmets, has been on display in the German city of Cologne at The Michael Schumacher Private Collection since June of last year.</p>, <p>"Michael can be proud of what he has achieved, and so are we," his family's statement said. "We want to remember and celebrate his victories, his records and his jubilation."</p>, <p>Schumacher has not been seen in public since his accident.</p>, <p>Brawn and Jean Todt \u2014 the head of motorsport's governing body FIA \u2014 are very close friends and have visited him at his Swiss home. Brawn reiterated the need for Schumacher to be shielded from the media spotlight.</p>, <p>"I am constantly in touch with (Schumacher's wife) Corinna and I totally agree with their decision," Brawn said. "Michael has always been a very private person."</p>, <p>The exhibitions in Cologne and Maranello are initiatives of the Keep Fighting Foundation, launched by Schumacher's family and of which Brawn and Todt are trustees.</p>, <p>RISING STAR</p>, <p>It was then-Ferrari general manager Todt who persuaded Schumacher to join him there after world titles with Benetton in 1994 and 1995, where he had developed a dazzlingly successful rapport with Brawn.</p>, <p>Todt rarely speaks publicly about Schumacher, out of respect, but revealed he watched the Brazilian GP with Schumacher at his Switzerland home in November.</p>, <p>Brawn spotted the young Schumacher's brazen talent during the World Sportscar Championship.</p>, <p>"He was doing lap times on less fuel than the others, and beating them by a mile," Brawn said, underling how even then Schumacher was "clearly incredibly quick."</p>, <p>They started working together at Benetton in 1991. A year later, Schumacher won his first F1 race at the Belgian GP and his astonishing career took off.</p>, <p>"In '94 when he won the first championship he was incredible," Brawn said.</p>, <p>Given his age and lack of experience at the time, Schumacher's breakthrough Benetton days were arguably equal to his stellar time with Ferrari.</p>, <p>"It's difficult to define a peak," Brawn told F1's official podcast.</p>, <p>HAMILTON CLOSING IN</p>, <p>                Five-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton has Schumacher's records within his sights, and age relatively on his side.</p>, <p>Given that the British driver is contracted with Mercedes for at least this season and next, he has a strong chance of equaling Schumacher's seven titles and number of race wins.</p>, <p>The 33-year-old Hamilton has won 73 races \u2014 18 behind but with a slightly higher win ratio than Schumacher had.</p>, <p>Hamilton, arguably F1's greatest ever talent in qualifying, has eclipsed Schumacher's record for pole positions: 83-68.</p>, <p>They are level for most podiums in a season with 17. But Schumacher leads him in terms of consecutive podiums finishes overall 19-16, as well as fastest laps with a staggering 77-41.</p>, <p>Schumacher also holds the F1 record for most wins at a single race: eight at the French GP.</p>, <p>RISING SON</p>, <p>Having raced against Schumacher in F1 and then replaced him at Mercedes, Hamilton could well end up driving against Schumacher's son.</p>, <p>All eyes will be on Mick Schumacher this year as he competes in F2 with the Prema Racing team.</p>, <p>The 19-year-old Schumacher won last year's F3 championship in style with eight wins and seven pole positions.</p>, <p>It was another racing title for the Schumacher family, and maybe not the last.</p>, <p>If Schumacher wins the F2 championship in 2019 then he, like other drivers such as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, could well be fast-tracked into F1.</p>, <p>\n<span class="ng_byline_name">By MICHAEL TARM </span><span class="ng_byline_credit">Associated Press</span>\n</p>, <p id="publish_date">January 03, 2019 06:26 PM<span></span></p>, <p id="update_date"></p>, <p>One of the most powerful and longest-serving City Council members in Chicago history has appeared in federal court on a charge that he tried to shake down a major fast-food restaurant chain seeking city remodeling permits.</p>, <p>#ReadLocal</p>, <p>Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year!

[<p data-page="1">To be affiliated with UCLA basketball is to dream.</p>, <p>To dream of becoming the program that properly collects and nurtures Southern California\u2019s reservoir of talent. To dream of returning to national prominence. To dream of recapturing the magic from the period when John Wooden was coach.</p>, <p>Reality is optional.</p>, <p>Now that Steve Alford has been fired, UCLA is dreaming again, more specifically about his permanent replacement and how that next coach will do what he couldn\u2019t.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/la-sp-lakers-lonzo-ball-ucla-earl-watson-20190102-story.html" target="_blank">While some prominent alumni have started advocating for former Bruins point guard Earl Watson</a>, the school\u2019s fantasy appointment remains Billy Donovan, the architect of the Florida program that won consecutive national championships in 2006 and 2007.</p>, <p>Two days after Alford\u2019s dismissal, Donovan happened to be in Los Angeles, about 10 miles from Pauley Pavilion. He wasn\u2019t here to stump for the UCLA post, but to coach his Oklahoma City Thunder against the Lakers at Staples Center.</p>, <p>Donovan said pretty much what would be expected from a coach under contract.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have a great group of guys and I\u2019ve enjoyed, really, working with these guys each and every day,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus is totally on the Thunder right now.\u201d</p>, <p>Donovan\u2019s All-Star guard, Russell Westbrook, wouldn\u2019t get involved in the discussion. Asked for his thoughts on what his alma mater should do, Westbrook replied, \u201cIt ain\u2019t up to me, champ.\u201d</p>, <p>Westbrook is a UCLA donor, however. The Bruins\u2019 practice court is named after him.</p>, <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t that big of a damn donor,\u201d he wisecracked.</p>, <p>To be clear, the chances of UCLA landing Donovan are remote. The Thunder recently exercised his option for the 2019-20 season, meaning he almost certainly won\u2019t be available when UCLA intensifies its search in the coming months.</p>, <p>But for the argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say UCLA can figure out a way to free Donovan from his deal. Would he really want a move to Westwood?</p>, <p>The Thunder entered Wednesday in third place in the Western Conference. The team has a couple of superstars in Westbrook and Paul George.</p>, <p>Alford earned $2.6 million annually. Even if UCLA goes all Chip Kelly and doubles that figure for its next coach, it will be less than Donovan\u2019s average annual salary of $6 million with the Thunder.</p>, <p>What the 53-year-old Donovan did say was recruiting obligations wouldn\u2019t be what deters him from returning to college basketball.</p>, <p>\u201cI think a lot of times, to be honest with you, sometimes that gets overblown,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI think there\u2019s this feeling that guys that have made the jump from college to the NBA left because of recruiting. I never felt that way. I always enjoyed recruiting. I liked recruiting.\u201d</p>, <p>Donovan spent more than two decades on the recruiting trail before he was appointed coach of the Thunder in 2015.</p>, <p>He started coaching as an assistant to then-Kentucky coach Rick Pitino, under whom he was a standout point guard at Providence. His first head coaching job consisted of a two-year stint at Marshall, after which he took over Florida at the age of 30.</p>, <p>Donovan constructed the program at Florida from the ground up. The school experienced limited basketball glory before his arrival. Over his 19 seasons with the Gators, he enjoyed the kind of sustained success UCLA is craving \u2014 four Final Fours, seven Elite Eights, 14 NCAA tournament appearances and 16 consecutive 20-win seasons.</p>, <p>The train wreck at UCLA can in part be traced back to him. Florida\u2019s opponent in the 2006 national championship game was UCLA. Florida\u2019s opponent in the 2007 national semifinal was also UCLA. The Bruins win those games and, who knows, maybe the second half of Ben Howland\u2019s reign would have played out differently.</p>, <p>So there was no truth to reports Donovan moved to the Thunder in part because he was exhausted of recruiting?</p>, <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of speculation \u2026\u201d he started.</p>, <p>He caught himself and asked a question in return: \u201cDid I say that?\u201d</p>, <p>No.</p>, <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he said with a smile.</p>, <p>Donovan continued, \u201cPeople say that all the time about different things and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said that. I\u2019ve always enjoyed the time that I had to recruit and meet different people and those kinds of things. Is it a lot of work? Yeah. Is it a lot of effort? Yes.\u201d</p>, <p>Sounds promising for UCLA? Well, here comes the \u201cbut\u201d \u2026</p>, <p>\u201cWhen the season ended in March, you couldn\u2019t really do anything basketball-wise,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThere was a lot of time. I feel like in the NBA, it\u2019s 12 months a year you\u2019re thinking about your team and you\u2019re thinking about basketball. I don\u2019t think that the notion that guys that leave college to go to the NBA is all because they don\u2019t want to recruit. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with that. I think you\u2019ll probably find most basketball coaches in college would love to be able to do basketball more than they\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d</p>, <p>He later reiterated that what he likes about the NBA is that \u201cyou\u2019re just dealing with basketball all day long.\u201d</p>, <p>So Donovan didn\u2019t exactly open the door for a move to Westwood.

[<p>Updated at 5:03 p.m. ET</p>, <p>Updated at 5:03 p.m. ET</p>, <p>After former USC assistant coach Tony Bland stood in federal court and admitted he had committed a felony \u2014 conspiracy to commit bribery \u2014 his attorney stood before the media and called the most clich\xe9d play in the college basketball playbook.</p>, <p>Not the pick-and-roll or the give-and-go or shouting, \u201cThe butler did it!\u201d</p>, <p>He blamed the NCAA.</p>, <p><strong>FACES OF 2019<br/><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/sport/features/sporting-news-players-athletes-to-watch-in-2019">SN selects young stars who will shape tomorrow's headlines</a></strong></p>, <p>\u201cThis is a case that is a product of a very broken, antiquated system,\u201d attorney Jeffrey Lichtman told reporters afterward, according to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-tony-bland-guilty-20190102-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>. \u201cHe was looking to help the players, but the problem is the way he went about it was wrong.</p>, <p>\u201cIf the NCAA is unwilling to police itself, I have respect for the Southern District of New York prosecutors for being willing to do it. This is a broken system.\u201d</p>, <p>It was a curious call \u2014 kind of like a fake-punt run by a fullback on fourth-and-5 \u2014 given that the count to which Bland pleaded guilty did not involve the sort of pay-for-players allegations that led to guilty verdicts in the fall against two former Adidas executives and a former agency representative.\xa0</p>, <p>Really, now, what role would the NCAA possibly have in regard\xa0to the count that led to Bland\u2019s plea? He acknowledged that, while he was employed as an assistant coach at Southern California, he accepted a $4,100 bribe as incentive to direct young athletes to employ a management firm headed by Munish Sood and Christian Dawkins.</p>, <p>\u201cWhatever the rules, taking money behind someone\u2019s back to steer him to an agent or financial adviser is wrong and illegal,\u201d an agency financial manager who wished to remain anonymous\xa0told Sporting News. \u201cAnd if the NCAA changed its amateurism rules, it would still be illegal to deal surreptitiously.\u201d</p>, <p>This charge was similar to the case against former Auburn assistant coach Chuck Person, which is set to go to trial next month. These circumstances have gained less attention than what was described during the trial of <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/college-basketball-corruption-trial-adidas-executives-ncaa-guilty-verdict-james-gatto-christian-dawkins-merl-code/1rx5f89spid3111nwauvijvlkf">Jim Gatto, Merl Code and Dawkins</a> last September,\xa0because the media always seem to focus more on alleged cheating creating a competitive advantage than the actions that can engender genuine victims. But what Bland has admitted and what Person will face at trial represents the most repulsive aspect of the government\u2019s case.</p>, <p>In a statement, U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman said Bland \u201cabused his position as a mentor and coach to student-athletes and aspiring professionals. He treated his players not as young men to counsel and guide, but as opportunities to enrich himself.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>SPORTING NEWS BEST OF 2018<br/><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/sport/features/best-of-2018">Read our\xa0favorite stories from the year in sports</a></strong></p>, <p>Person has been charged with receiving more than $90,000, in part as incentive to direct athletes to Pittsburgh-based financial manager Marty Blazer. A simple Google search shows that Blazer in May 2016 <a href="https://triblive.com/business/headlines/10429527-74/blazer-financial-money" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faced a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> for allegedly taking $2.35 million from athletes' accounts as part of a Ponzi scheme. He was eventually ordered to pay <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23900.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about $1.8 million</a>.</p>, <p>Bland originally had been accused of accepting a $13,000 bribe, but the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/la-sp-college-basketball-bland-20181116-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times reported</a> that Dawkins\xa0made a deposit of $8,900 at a Las Vegas bank on\xa0the same day in August 2017 that the bribe was alleged to have occurred. The figure to which Bland admitted accepting apparently represents the difference between Dawkins' deposit and the original figure Bland was accused of receiving.</p>, <p>However, if Bland had used Google to look up Dawkins in advance of their meeting, he likely would have <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/5/4/15549768/sports-agent-fired-42000-in-uber-charges-nba-players-credit-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discovered a story</a> about Dawkins losing his position at ASM Sports after it was alleged he\u2019d used an athlete\u2019s account to ring up $42,000 in Uber fares. Whether Bland knew of this in advance of their meeting was not germane to the government\u2019s case, but the ease of access to this information demonstrates how indefensible Bland\u2019s actions were in accepting the bribe.</p>, <p>In court, of course, Bland was entitled to a defense, and he got one. He is expected to receive probation, and the outcome certainly could have been worse. Afterward, Lichtman called Bland \u201cthe most decent man\u201d he had represented.</p>, <p>That plea for your sympathy \u2014 as did his call for antipathy toward the NCAA \u2014 fell more than a few yards short.</p>]

[<p></p>, <p>HOUSTON\u2014<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/james-harden">James Harden</a> normally doesn't have a propensity to pontificate about himself or his exploits on the court. Whenever\xa0he's questioned about basketball, he's succinct, reserved, contemplative.\xa0He lets his game do the talking.</p>, <p><span>And for the month of December, it was record-breaking.</span></p>, <p><span>The <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a>'s reigning MVP scored 408 points, dished out 89 assists and pulled down 68 rebounds over his last 10 games.\xa0</span>It was the most points, assists and rebounds logged over a 10-game span by any player in <a href="https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1080214629366804480" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBA history</a>.\xa0But as impressive as those stats were, they weren't loud enough.</p>, <p><span>Perhaps annoyed by the viral memes attacking his step-back jumper and various trolling comments proliferating the internet, Harden erupted with an impassioned statement about securing back-to-back MVPs that sent a jolt through the league like a crack of thunder.</span></p>, <p><span>"Of course I should be in that conversation. I mean, I receive a lot of hate, but it won't stop me from going out there and killing every single night, being that dog that I am," <span>Harden said with a hint of bluster last week</span>. "You can name a few other people that should be in the conversation. But realistically? It's coming back."</span></p>, <p><span>That was quite the quote from a player whose sartorial whims speak louder than he does. But as the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> (21-15) begin their new year with a nationally televised game against the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a> in Oracle Arena on Thursday, he opted for the exclamation point.</span></p>, <p><span>"I need it. I need it for sure," Harden told Bleacher Report's\xa0<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813620-rockets-james-harden-on-winning-a-2nd-mvp-need-it-for-sure-and-im-getting-it" target="_blank">Will Gottlieb</a>\xa0when asked if he's hungry for winning another MVP. "And I'm going to get it."</span></p>, <p>There it is. One of Harden's resolutions for 2019 is earning another\xa0Maurice Podoloff Trophy.</p>, <p>But does he deserve it?</p>, <p>The judging guidelines for MVP are subjective and esoteric, but if the judges focus solely on numbers, Harden has an airtight case.</p>, <p>"He's by far the MVP," head coach Mike D'Antoni said. "Nobody does what he does on a nightly basis."</p>, <p>The Western Conference Player of the Week recorded his fourth triple-double of the season Monday night with 43 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in the Rockets' 113-101 win over the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/memphis-grizzlies">Memphis Grizzlies</a> and his eighth straight game with at least 35 points and five assists, passing Oscar Robertson for the record.\xa0He also joined Michael Jordan and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/kobe-bryant">Kobe Bryant</a> as the third player\xa0over the last 30 years to drop at least 400 points over 10 games.</p>, <p><span>With The Beard's dominant finish to 2018, Houston moved from 14th to fourth in the Western Conference.</span></p>, <p>"I don't know how you get any better than what he's playing," D'Antoni added. "Defensively, too. He comes up with steals, triple-doubles like it's nothing. So, yeah, he's playing at a different level."</p>, <p>Harden hit another gear during the Rockets' recent 10-1 run, averaging an eye-popping 39.7 points, 8.5 assists, 6.3 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 5.5 made three-pointers per game, but critics won't easily forget how the team started the season.</p>, <p>At the beginning of last month, only the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a> had a worse record in the West.\xa0Houston started at 11-14, and that grated at Harden, so he went to work.</p>, <p>"He comes in and does extra work," D'Antoni said. "He knew he had to take his body to one more level up. He had to get into a better rhythm. He's been playing a lot of one-on-one. He's been doing a lot of extra work in the weight room. He's been putting his time in. Obviously, it's paying dividends."</p>, <p>Harden is averaging a league-leading 33.3 points per contest, the highest scoring average since Bryant's 35.4 points per game in 2005-06.\xa0He's also stepped forward as a leader, making sure his teammates are as locked in as he is.</p>, <p>"He's making sure guys get extra work in after practice," Gerald Green said. "Making sure guys are focused on pregame. He does a lot of little things you probably don't see on camera."</p>, <p>Harden's array of three-pointers, Eurosteps in the lane, tomahawk dunks and crafty passes may come off as entertaining on camera, but there's something else that comes through just as clearly as the highlights: his high usage rate.</p>, <p>At <a href="https://stats.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=USG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*15&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">37.4</a>, he has the ball in his hands a lot, and that level of play can be exhausting and unsustainable.\xa0Will Harden get burned out from being a one-man show?</p>, <p>With <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> sidelined long term with a hamstring injury and Eric Gordon out with a right knee contusion, it's not surprising that the bat signal went up in Space City and Harden had to answer the call with a December to remember.</p>, <p>But as the season unfolds, his numbers will eventually come back to earth, and that's when the Rockets' record will come into play.\xa0Houston's climb back into the playoff picture gives Harden the hot hand in the MVP race, but like last year, it will come down to the team's final record.</p>, <p>Through all of the discretionary fog, the MVP ideally goes to the best player on the best team.\xa0By those standards,\xa0Giannis Antetokounmpo of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> (26-10) is the top candidate, followed by Kawhi Leonard of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/toronto-raptors">Toronto Raptors</a> (28-11).</p>, <p>Harden was an easy choice last season because Houston finished with the best record in the league at 65-17, and his numbers were off the charts.\xa0If he can lead his team to the No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the West by the time the voters have to make their selection, he'll have a legitimate chance at repeating.</p>, <p>Luckily for Harden, there appears to be great parity in the league this year. There is no real dominant team when considering records.</p>, <p>The defending champion Warriors have the fifth-best record in the league, and the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> have the eighth-best. Both teams were earmarked as the favorites to make the NBA Finals.\xa0The <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/denver-nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> are playing surprisingly well, so for now, everything is up for grabs.</p>, <p>Another plus for the Rockets is they seem to have found the right mix of players.</p>, <p>Danuel House is found money, and Austin Rivers looks like a perfect fit for D'Antoni's system.\xa0Houston is averaging 7.9 more made three-pointers than its opponents since the 126-111 win over the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> on Dec. 13 and has out-rebounded opponents in seven of the last 10 games.</p>, <p>The Rockets have also\xa0won close games and have taken a huge step defensively.\xa0They are 24th in defensive efficiency for the year at 111 but are 10th over the last 10 games at <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*15&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=12%2F13%2F2018&amp;DateTo=12%2F31%2F2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">107.8</a>.</p>, <p>If CP3 gets healthy and Gordon recaptures his ability to knock down open threes, Houston could be poised to mirror the team that everyone saw last season.\xa0That can only improve Harden's chances at making good on his prediction.</p>, <p>"There's a lot of games left, but if he continues to play at this level, of course there is no debate on who is the MVP," Clint Capela said. "I mean, we all see what he's doing. Everybody sees it. All he has to do is keep playing at this level every single night, and he's the MVP."</p>, <p>\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0</p>, <p><em>Unless otherwise indicated, all stats courtesy of\xa0<a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basketball Reference</a>\xa0or\xa0<a href="http://stats.nba.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>.</em></p>, <p><em>Maurice Bobb covers the<span>\xa0</span>NBA<span>\xa0</span>for Bleacher Report.

[<p class="label">\n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t</p>, <p>Don\u2019t tell Chad Reed that he is over the hill because right now he is still having too much fun flying over them. \n<p>Supercross is a brutal, bone-jarring sport, and at 36, riders are usually several pages into the next chapter of their lives, icing their bruises and aching joints. \n<p>But Reed keeps going \u2026 and going.

You have a better grasp of understanding what you just did, and take care of yourself then and there,\u201d Reed said. \u201cAnd then that way when you do wake up the next day, it is improved, and you have already started the recovery process. That only comes after spending 20 years in the sport.\u201d \n<p>He\u2019s in much better shape than he was at this point one year ago. When he showed up for the first race in Anaheim last January, he was just beginning to take his first steps after breaking his right ankle a few months earlier. \n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have been up and around at the time, but he needed to get moving if he was going to have any chance to sit on his Husqvarna at Angel Stadium. \n<p>He finished 15th in the main event and went on to ride in all 17 races on the schedule, making his 228th start in Tampa to break Mike LaRocco\u2019s all-time record. \n<p>But his ankle, being held together by a plate and four screws, was a constant issue. <div class="dfp-ad dfp-Cube_Article" data-ad-unit="Cube_Article" id="div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article">\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article"); } );\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cAnd because of that, I wasn\u2019t in shape.

I feel I have ticked those boxes.\u201d \n<p>\xa0 \n </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>, <p>\u201cAnd because of that, I wasn\u2019t in shape. I wasn\u2019t healthy,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI never had the fitness. I took a lot of time off in May (after the season ended) to work on range of motion and getting back in shape. That was the most difficult season of my career. This year, I want to put more emphasis on being competitive. I want to be the oldest guy to win a race, I don\u2019t know why but that is important to me.\u201d \n<p>And there\u2019s a good chance this season that Reed could steal another record from LaRocco, who won the 2004 Indianapolis main event when he was 33 years, 1 month and 8 days old. \n<p>Reed is finally back on a factory bike, joining Justin Hill at the Suzuki-backed Joe Gibbs Racing team. Weston Peick was supposed to be at this race for Gibbs. At first glance, Reed said it\u2019s easy to assume that he is filling in for Peick, who suffered severe facial injuries when a bike essentially landed on his face during a race in Paris on Nov. 17. \n<p>But Reed said the goal was to be a third rider on the team. His bike and its parts had a corner of the shop since sometime around August, and he didn\u2019t move into Peick\u2019s place after the crash. \n<p>Reed said he has a contract to keep him on a bike through the Supercross season should Peick happen to make a miraculous recovery. \n<p>\u201cAnd we would love to have that problem,\u201d Reed said. \n<p>But three riders definitely make a full-house in a Supercross where two-bike teams are the norm, and currently JGR is not fully funded, Reed said. They have been diving deep into Reed\u2019s little black book from when he owned his own team, hoping to find a sponsor. \n<p>And for Reed, that is not a problem at all. \xa0Chasing corporate dollars was one of the things he enjoyed the most when he ran his own program from the end of 2010 through 2015. \n<p>When he does finally does finally give up riding, he said he\u2019d love to fill that type of role for a team, running he day-to-day operations. \n<p><aside class="related left"><h2 class="widget-title" data-curated-ids="" data-relation-type="automatic-primary-section">Related Articles</h2><ul><li>\n<a class="article-title" href="https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/03/eli-tomac-starts-quest-for-third-consecutive-supercross-title/" title="Eli Tomac starts quest for third consecutive Supercross title">\n<span class="dfm-title">\n\t\t\tEli Tomac starts quest for third consecutive Supercross title\t\t</span>\n</a>\n</li><li>\n<a class="article-title" href="https://www.ocregister.com/2018/12/27/super-trucks-will-be-a-part-of-grand-prix-of-long-beach-in-years-ahead/" title="Super Trucks will be a part of Grand Prix of Long Beach in years ahead">\n<span class="dfm-title">\n\t\t\tSuper Trucks will be a part of Grand Prix of Long Beach in years ahead\t\t</span>\n</a>\n</li></ul></aside>And he could be ready to make the move in the near future. \n<p>Reed, a 44-time main event winner and two-time series champion, said this could be his last season. \n<p>\u201cBut for me, there is never a plan.

[<p>PFF Fantasy brings you DFS player projections and lineup advice to help you build your daily fantasy football lineups.</p>, <p>Who are the best fantasy football plays for building an optimal DFS lineup during the 2018 Wild Card Weekend? As we do every week, this piece brings you the DFS locks for the main slate.</p>, <p>This piece will go over the players you can lock into your DFS lineups for optimal performance.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-274948" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" src="https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Andrew-Luck-vs-Houston.png" srcset="https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Andrew-Luck-vs-Houston.png 1918w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Andrew-Luck-vs-Houston-300x169.png 300w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Andrew-Luck-vs-Houston-768x432.png 768w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Andrew-Luck-vs-Houston-1024x577.png 1024w" width="1918"/></p>, <p>Despite playing on the road this weekend, Luck is traveling to Houston to face a familiar foe in a controlled-environment setting. In two games against the Texans this year, Luck went ham (399 yards and two touchdowns in Week 4) and nuclear (464 yards and four touchdowns in Week 4). This game has the highest projected over/under of the slate (49). Luck will likely be the highest-owned quarterback, but he\u2019s impossible to fade.</p>, <p>Watson, fantasy\u2019s <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-facts-to-know-for-wild-card-weekend-2018">No. 2 quarterback over the second half of the season</a>, is playing as a home favorite in a game with the highest over/under and best <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-snaps-pace-stats-wild-card-2018">snap pace outlook</a>. Watson pummeled Indy for 375 passing yards and two passing touchdowns along with 41 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown back in Week 4 and put together a respectable (albeit less explosive) performance against them in Week 14. Watson has been on fire, this game has the best floor/ceiling combination of the weekend, and he\u2019s playing in a favorable game environment \u2014 what\u2019s not to like?</p>, <p>Elliott comes in fresh off Dallas\u2019 Week 17 built-in bye to face a Seahawks rush defense that has hemorrhaged 4.6 rushing YPC against on the season and 5.1 YPC against over the second half of the year. Running backs have also hauled in 102 receptions against Seattle this year, fifth-most in the NFL.</p>, <p>Carson finished the season fifth in rushing yards (1,151) and was first in rushing attempts over the final month (90). Dallas\u2019 rush defense was gashed over the final three weeks, giving up 112 rushing yards per game and 1.7 rushing TDs per game. Carson is still relatively cheap compared to how he performed over the second half of the season \u2014 and especially over the final month.</p>, <p>Miller is extremely cheap ($4,900 on DraftKings; $6,400 on FanDuel), and I\u2019m considering him a great play relative to his salary. Miller has over 95 total yards and/or a touchdown in seven of his last eight healthy games, with four 100-yard rushing efforts in that span (important if you\u2019re playing DraftKings). The Colts rush defense is average \u2014 this isn\u2019t a <em>great</em> matchup, but it\u2019s certainly not bad \u2014 and the Texans are slight home favorites in a game with the best scoring potential.</p>, <p>Indianapolis did a good job keeping Hopkins in check in Week 14 \u2014 he had a 4-36-1 (10) line in that game \u2014 but Hopkins shredded them in Week 4 with a 10-169-1 (12) performance. Over the final three games of the season, Hopkins had 31 receptions on 39 targets for 421 yards. You can\u2019t afford to pass up his floor/ceiling combination on such a short slate.</p>, <p>Hilton doesn\u2019t have nearly the same target volume as Hopkins, but he can \u201cget there\u201d with only half as many opportunities. Hilton blasted Houston for 9-199-0 (12) in Week 14 and 4-115-0 (6) in Week 4. In his career, Hilton <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-facts-to-know-for-wild-card-weekend-2018">averages</a> over 100 yards and 0.6 touchdowns per game against Houston.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-274949" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" src="https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Allen-Robinson-Targets.png" srcset="https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Allen-Robinson-Targets.png 1920w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Allen-Robinson-Targets-300x169.png 300w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Allen-Robinson-Targets-768x432.png 768w, https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/01/Allen-Robinson-Targets-1024x576.png 1024w" width="1920"/></p>, <p>Robinson, one of the league\u2019s leading <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-facts-to-know-for-wild-card-weekend-2018">positive touchdown regression candidates</a>, squares off against a depleted Eagles secondary that has allowed the third-most fantasy points to opposing receivers this season. Robinson has at least seven targets in six of his last seven games.</p>, <p>Ertz has been one of the most bankable fantasy tight ends all season long, and that\u2019s not going to change in the playoffs with only four games on tap. Ertz has shown a volatile floor/ceiling combination over the last three games with <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/nfl/players/nick-foles/7089">Nick Foles</a>, producing just 4.5 PPR points last week after scoring 38 DraftKings points the week before. The big swings make him a viable GPP fade, but I\u2019ll take his <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-facts-to-know-for-wild-card-weekend-2018">record-setting targets</a> in cash.</p>, <p>Ebron is one of the other tight ends we\u2019ve been comfortable playing in 2018, and we should be grateful to have both him and Ertz to choose from this weekend. Ebron has a better on-paper matchup against the Texans, who have allowed the second-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends this season. This year, Ebron averaged nine targets per game against Houston with a touchdown in both games.</p>]

[<p>The Buffalo Sabres hit the halfway mark of their schedule Thursday against a team they would probably rather not see on the other side of the ice.</p>, <p>The Florida Panthers are in KeyBank Center for 7:05 faceoff \u2013 and own a seven-game winning streak over the Sabres. Buffalo's only point in that stretch came during a 3-2 overtime loss in Sunrise on Nov. 30. Florida has outscored the Sabres, 27-11, in the seven games but the streak belies Florida's place in the standings as the Panthers (17-15-6) are eight points behind the Sabres (21-13-6) in the Atlantic Division.</p>, <p>But the teams are heading in opposite directions of late. Buffalo is 0-2-1 in its last three games and 4-7-4 in its last 15 while the Panthers are 6-2 in their last eight.</p>, <p><strong>Here are Five Things to Know about tonight's game:</strong></p>, <p><strong>1. Lineup news:</strong> In case you missed it earlier, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/01/03/jack-eichel-buffalo-sabres-nhl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coach Phil Housley announced that captain Jack Eichel (upper body) will miss tonight's game and Saturday's game in Boston</a> before being re-evaluated next week. That puts Evan Rodrigues to the top line. Lawrence Pilut is expected to return on defense. The Sabres had a very optional morning skate today so lines from practice yesterday are the only clue to what we might see tonight.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="fi"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sabres?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Sabres</a> today<br/>Skinner-ERod-Reinhart<br/>Smith-Larsson-Okposo<br/>Sheary-Sobotka-Thompson<br/>Elie-Mittelstadt-Pominville<br/>---<br/>McCabe-Ristolainen<br/>Pilut-Bogosian<br/>Scandella-Dahlin<br/>Beaulieu-Hunwick</p>, <p>\u2014 Mike Harrington (@ByMHarrington) <a href="https://twitter.com/ByMHarrington/status/1080500648981024768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2019</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p><strong>2. Security blanket in net:</strong> Linus Ullmark is developing into one of the NHL's best backups with season stats of 8-1-3, 2.71/.922. He's won three straight starts \u2013 posting a 1.65 goals-against average and .953 save percentage \u2013 and will get the call tonight for the Sabres.</p>, <p>"He's played outstanding for us, even when we haven't given him the run support," Housley said. "He's got two shutouts. Hopefully the trend continues where he's in net and we continue to give him support. I really like the games he's played in.

Nemesis in the other net:</strong> The Panthers will counter with 39-year-old Roberto Luongo, who has killed the Sabres in his career to the tune of 20-8-0/1.96/.934. He beat Buffalo here, 5-2,\xa0 during the Panthers' last visit Dec. 18.</p>, <p>"We need to get more people in front of him," Housley said. "There are going to be rebounds to be had but we've got to get there to try to get to that opportunity.</p>, <p>"Get in front of him, take his eyes away," Rodrigues said when asked about facing the 6-foot-3 Luongo. "If he can't see it, he can't stop it."</p>, <p><strong>4. Tough matchup:</strong> It doesn't get a ton of publicity but the Panthers have one of the best No. 1 lines in hockey with Aleksander Barkov (15-24-39) centering Jonathan Huberdeau (10-34-44) and Evgenii Dadonov (17-18-35). Dadonov scored the tying goal in the third period and Huberdeau fed Barkov for the overtime winner\xa0 to beat Buffalo when the teams played in Sunrise.</p>, <p>"They've got some skilled guys and their back end can move it pretty well too and it puts them in good position," Skinner said today. "It's like any game in this league: It's a challenge and it's tough to win. Tonight is going to be no different.

[<p>\r\n                  Wednesday, Jan 02, 2019 07:04 PM\r\n                </p>, <p>Seahawks.com Reporter</p>, <p>The 2018 season has been a difficult one for Doug Baldwin. Injuries took their toll on the Seahawks receiver, who missed three games and played at something less than 100 percent for pretty much all of the other 13 games.</p>, <p>Baldwin, who had 29 touchdowns in the previous three seasons, didn\u2019t secure his first touchdown pass until Week 11, his reaction to that score after the game being a one word response of, \u201cfinally.\u201d And after piling up 247 catches and 3,188 yards in the previous three seasons and earning Pro-Bowl honors twice, Baldwin was limited to 50 catches for 618 yards and five touchdowns this year.</p>, <p>Baldwin, who missed training camp and the preseason with knee injury, only to hurt his other knee in the regular-season opener, causing him to miss the next two games, has battled knee, groin, hip, elbow and shoulder injuries throughout this season, and he again is on the injury report this week with a knee injury that limited him in Wednesday\u2019s practice.</p>, <p>But despite that designation, Baldwin has been healthier lately than he was for much of the regular season, which has shown in the impact he has made in recent games, most notably his 126-yard game in a Week 16 win over Kansas City that saw him make two of the game\u2019s biggest plays on very high degree-of-difficulty catches. And now that the Seahawks are in the playoffs, Baldwin feels like he can put all the struggles of the regular season behind him and start over relatively healthy and ready to help the Seahawks go on what they hope can be a long playoff run.</p>, <p>\u201cThe biggest thing is the emotional part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in the playoffs so it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s thrown at you. You can handle it, and there\u2019s a newness or a refreshing feeling to it because you feel like you\u2019re going into a tournament where anything can happen, and the only thing that really matters is winning, so you put aside everything that you\u2019ve been dealing with in the past subconsciously and you can go for it. I mean, I was talking to our equipment staff yesterday about this. I just feel so much more vibrant. The energy is there because I know it\u2019s playoff time. We look forward to these moments, and I\u2019m not saying that we treat them differently, I\u2019m just saying that there\u2019s a certain energy when you get into the tournament. It\u2019s undeniable.\u201d</p>, <p>As Baldwin noted, the Seahawks aren\u2019t preparing for Saturday\u2019s game against the Cowboys any differently that they would a regular-season game. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has always preached the importance of treating every game as a championship opportunity, and that doesn\u2019t change whether it\u2019s the first week of the regular season or the Super Bowl, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a certain buzz in the air come playoff time, even if it doesn\u2019t change preparation this week. And for a player who has battled through a difficult season full of injuries, that extra energy can provide a boost.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a refreshing feeling in some ways,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cAgain, the playoffs, to me, it just starts everything over again. Your mindset starts over again. Everything that\u2019s happened in the past, we\u2019ve put that behind us and we\u2019ve focused on what we can control. It is what it is, in terms of injuries, but it doesn\u2019t matter now. There\u2019s no more excuses. We\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got four more games.\u201d</p>, <p>And while players like Baldwin and <a href="https://www.seahawks.com/news/k-j-wright-s-return-bolsters-seahawks-defense-heading-into-playoffs">linebacker K.J. Wright</a> are grateful for this return to the playoffs in part because it represents a fresh start after battling injuries all season, even their teammates who played all 16 games are especially appreciative to be back in the postseason after falling short in 2017. Veterans like Bobby Wagner and Russell Wilson, both members of Seattle\u2019s 2012 draft class, had never missed the playoffs before the Seahawks went 9-7 last year and missed out on a Wild Card berth, while Wright and Baldwin only missed the playoffs as rookies in 2011 prior to last season. Not that those four or other veterans took the playoffs for granted in the past, but having felt the disappointment of last year, getting back in a year later is a special feeling, especially in a season in which a lot of outside observers thought the Seahawks would take a step back, not get better.</p>, <p>\u201cMy whole mindset was to never miss it again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201c\u2026 You always want to have a chance. Whenever you get to December, you want to have a chance to make it. I think that\u2019s kind of always been my thought is give ourselves a great chance to go where we want to go, and that\u2019s to win the whole thing. I think at the end of the day, we\u2019ve been able to do that extremely, extremely well. Even last year when we didn\u2019t make it, we still had a chance, a really, really close chance. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t make it last year, but every year\u2019s a new year. The great thing about this team is the fact that everybody was telling us we couldn\u2019t. I think that it shows the will of this team. It shows the heart of this team and it shows the mindset of this team to be able to think the way that you want to think and go the places that you want to go.\u201d</p>, <p>Prior to last season, the Seahawks had not only made the playoffs every year since 2012, but won at least one playoff game, meaning they were, at worst, one of the final eight teams standing for five straight seasons, so it\u2019s no wonder that Wagner had a rather blunt assessment of watching football from home at a time of year he was used to playing meaningful games.</p>, <p>\u201cIt sucked,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt was terrible. We had made the playoffs my whole time here since I\u2019ve been here, so when you had that time off, you have to\u2014the first couple of weeks, it just kind of felt like a bye week where it\u2019s just like \u2018All right, well other teams are playing and you\u2019re not.\u2019 Then, when you\u2019re starting to work out and get ready for next season and realize the season is still going, it\u2019s a terrible feeling to be done in January, so I\u2019m going to do my best to make sure it never happens again.\u201d</p>, <p>Wright, showing the same connection with Wagner that on the field has made them one of the league\u2019s best linebacker tandems, had a very similar description of missing the postseason.</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I\u2019ve always been to the playoffs since I\u2019ve been here. Playoff football, it\u2019s just fun, it\u2019s just so much better\u2026 I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re in it this year, and we\u2019ve got to do something while we\u2019re in it.\u201d</p>, <p>Asked if missing the playoffs made him more appreciative of being back, Wright said, \u201cMost definitely. We came up short last year, we didn\u2019t get it done, and we just got back to the drawing board. We had an interesting offseason, but we found a way to make it happen.\u201d</p>, <p>The Seahawks and Cowboys will meet for the second time in the postseason this Saturday in Dallas.

[<p>Count Warriors big man Kevon Looney among those who think Golden State could use another center.</p>, <p>\u201cWe used to have six or seven centers on the roster, so another one won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Looney said after shootaround Thursday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re all different. Whatever Coach and (general manager) Bob (Myers) think we need, we probably need it.</p>, <p>\u201cWith (DeMarcus Cousins) still out, we need some more big bodies. In case one of us gets into foul trouble, we just need someone who\u2019s big, can get some rebounds and match up with some guys. It\u2019ll help.\u201d</p>, <p>Looney\u2019s comments came three days after Myers conceded that \u201c<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Warriors-interested-in-adding-another-center-13500854.php">we\u2019ve got a little bit of a void at the five-spot</a>, which we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on, whether that\u2019s through trade or a buyout.\u201d Head coach Steve Kerr echoed the sentiment, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to get DeMarcus into the fold. But even then, there\u2019s probably room for one more center.\u201d</p>, <p>With Damian Jones likely done for the season with a pectoral injury, the Warriors are without a prototypical center until the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Cousins returns from a torn left Achilles tendon. The undersized Looney and Jordan Bell, with cameos from power forwards Draymond Green and Jonas Jerebko, are anchoring Golden State inside.</p>, <p>Not surprisingly, the results have been uneven. With no one to match some of the top big men\u2019s size, the Warriors have repeatedly gotten bullied on the offensive glass and in the paint.</p>, <p>But with no serviceable 7-foot centers immediately available, Golden State, which has an open roster spot, is left hoping someone surfaces in the trade or buyout markets. The trade deadline is Feb. 7, and the buyout market effectively ends March 1.</p>, <p>In the meantime, Looney, Bell and others will try hold the Warriors over. Their next big test comes Thursday night against Houston\u2019s Clint Capela. At 6-foot-10, 240 pounds with speed that belies his size, Capela teams with James Harden to form one of the NBA\u2019s most daunting pick-and-roll duos. In 33.8 minutes per game this season, Capela is averaging 17 points on 63.6 percent shooting, 12.5 rebounds and 1.9 blocks.</p>, <p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve gotten kind of used to playing against those types of guys,\u201d Looney said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of tough. Those guys are real physical, and it\u2019s hard to be physical back sometimes, because you get into foul trouble. That\u2019s kind of frustrating.\u201d</p>, <p>Connor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: <a href="mailto:cletourneau@sfchronicle.com">cletourneau@sfchronicle.com</a>.

In basketball, the hardest way would be through a loss but Weber State is hoping it wised up through Saturday\u2019s <a href="https://www.standard.net/sports/weber-state/weber-state-blasts-idaho-in-st-half-scratches-out-win/article_500e1804-0cee-55d4-8ad7-87a1d2a16671.html" target="_blank">93-87 win at Idaho</a> as it prepares for a Big Sky homestand against Northern Arizona and Southern Utah.</p>, <p>With a 52-30 halftime lead, the Wildcats kept that margin through the opening segment of the second half when Brekkott Chapman drove baseline and <a href="https://twitter.com/WeberStateMBB/status/1079877543178584064" target="_blank">dunked over UI\u2019s Scott Blakney</a> for a 60-38 lead.</p>, <p>But Idaho slowly worked back into the game and, when Cameron Tyson drained three tough 3-pointers in the final 1:21, it nearly put the game in doubt. WSU allowed 57 second-half points.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat we did is kind of fooled ourselves into thinking it\u2019s OK to go through the motions,\u201d senior center Zach Braxton said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Weber State does. We\u2019re not going to do it again. Not this year.\u201d</p>, <p>It was the first time since Dec. 1 that Weber State appeared to take a half of defense off \u2014 a game against BYU in which the Wildcats also gave up 57 second-half points. But in that track meet, WSU scored 66 itself that half and won.</p>, <p>Head coach Randy Rahe credited Idaho for playing well and relaxing out of halftime. But he said Idaho gained confidence through easy looks, leading to tougher made baskets, and the Vandals got rolling.</p>, <p>\u201cA lot had to do with our edge or urgency. We didn\u2019t maintain it. We allowed them to get back in it and make it interesting,\u201d Rahe said.</p>, <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen.

In the three-plus seasons since, the \u2018Jacks have 22 total wins.</p>, <p>This season hasn\u2019t looked any better, results-wise, but NAU did play eight true road games in its non-conference schedule and Rahe says they look better than the team WSU beat twice by 30-plus points last season.</p>, <p>\u201cThey upgraded their talent,\u201d Rahe said. \u201cI see a team that\u2019s playing with a lot of confidence right now. They played well against Montana State, they played Montana really tough for 35 minutes. They are fast, they are athletic and very, very aggressive.\u201d</p>, <p>Some of those new faces: Carlos Hines (13 points per game) and Bernie Andre (11.5) lead the \u2018Jacks in scoring. NAU has five road losses to teams rated similarly to or worse than Weber State by an average of 14 points per contest.</p>, <p>WSU has won 18 of its last 20 against NAU.</p>, <p><strong>SOUTHERN UTAH (JAN. 5)</strong></p>, <p>Southern Utah (5-6, 0-2) visits the Dee Events Center on Saturday after a rough start to conference play.

This can greatly simplify or complicate the matter," Kubica said.</p>, <p>From the start to the finish of the 2018 season, Williams' drivers lingered at the tail end of the field, with Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin endlessly struggling with the aero inefficiencies and weaknesses of the FW41.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-313233" height="799" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="http://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/XPB_953034_1200px.jpg" srcset="http://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/XPB_953034_1200px.jpg 1200w, http://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/XPB_953034_1200px-768x511.jpg 768w, http://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/XPB_953034_1200px-545x363.jpg 545w, http://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/XPB_953034_1200px-1000x666.jpg 1000w" width="1200"/></p>, <p>During testing, Kubica experienced firsthand the car's troubles, saying that dealing with its flaws was like "dancing with a partner who cannot dance".</p>, <p>"If a car does not perform as the driver expects, it is not even so much about the speed and the lap times, but the feeling that it gives that can hinder the driver," he added.</p>, <p><strong><u><a href="http://en.f1i.com/gallery/274524-gallery-f1-drivers-wives-and-girlfriends.html">Gallery: The beautiful wives and girlfriends of F1 drivers</a></u></strong></p>, <p><em>Keep up to date with all the F1 news via <strong><u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/F1icom">Facebook</a></u></strong> and <strong><u><a href="https://twitter.com/F1icom">Twitter</a></u></strong></em></p>, <p></p>, <p>Keep informed with the latest F1 news, reports and results from F1i.com.

The 25-year-old left-winger was picked once again Wednesday to represent the Pacific Division at the 2018 NHL All-Star Game, marking his fifth consecutive call to the mid-season showcase.</p>, <p>\u201cEveryone sees his skill and you see how dynamic he is, but if you haven\u2019t coached him, you don\u2019t know how competitive he is and how passionate he is,\u201d praised Bill Peters, an admirer from afar before being hired as Flames bench boss this past summer. \u201cThose are the things that stick out for me that you weren\u2019t aware of, because you have to be around him every day to see it. It burns bright, and it\u2019s each and every day.\u201d</p>, <p>There was all sorts of good news Wednesday for Gaudreau.</p>, <p>Shortly after morning skate at Little Caesars Arena, he was named the NHL\u2019s second star of the month. Just before puck-drop, he officially booked his trip to the NHL\u2019s all-star shindig in San Jose.</p>, <p>Neither comes as any sort of surprise. (The stumper is that Flames captain Mark Giordano, an early frontrunner for the Norris Trophy, isn\u2019t on the initial roster for the Pacific Division, although he is an option on\xa0the\xa0\u2018Last Man In\u2019\xa0fan vote.)</p>, <p>Gaudreau racked up 11 goals and 15 assists in 14 outings during a dazzling December.</p>, <p>Only Tampa Bay Lightning stud Nikita Kucherov, a no-brainer for top honours after the first 30-point month in the NHL since March of 2001, did more scoresheet damage as Santa was loading his sleigh and then digesting all those cookies.</p>, <p>Only Kucherov\u2019s teammate, Steven Stamkos, tickled more twine than Gaudreau over that same span.</p>, <p>For Gaudreau, 26 points on the same calendar page is a new career-best. His December to remember included nine multiple-point performances, one hat-trick and an impressive plus-15 rating.</p>, <p>Johnny Hockey\u2019s first-line pals, centre Sean Monahan and right-winger Elias Lindholm, also enjoyed the most productive months of their respective careers.</p>, <p>\u201cMony and Lindy have been playing really well \u2014 we\u2019ve been <a href="https://calgarysun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames/flames-top-line-up-there-with-the-best-in-nhl">getting some good chemistry together</a>, so it\u2019s been a lot of fun playing with those guys,\u201d Gaudreau said after the morning prep in Detroit. \u201cAnd when I\u2019ve been getting my chances, they\u2019ve been going in. So that has been nice, too.</p>, <p>\u201cPart of my role on this team is creating offence and when I\u2019m not doing that, I feel like I\u2019m letting the team down. You have to come out every night trying to create that offence and our whole line, I think, believes that we can do that night-in and night-out. It doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re playing against.</p>, <p>\u201cWe had a good month there. Obviously there are ups and downs throughout a season, but hopefully we can keep this thing going.\u201d</p>, <p>\n<span class="img-caption">\nCalgary Flames Johnny Gaudreau celebrates with the purple Gatorade with teammates Sean Monahan and Elias Lindholm after scoring a power play goal against the San Jose Sharks at the Scotiabank Saddledome on Monday, Dec. 31, 2018.</span>\n<span class="img-author">\n<span itemprop="creator">Al Charest/Postmedia</span></span>\n</p>, <p>Gaudreau arrived in Detroit \u2014 the first stop on a four-game roadie, the midway point on the 82-game regular-season slate \u2014 with 21 tallies and 34 assists already.</p>, <p>The last time a Flames\u2019 skater sizzled to 55 points in the first 40 games of a campaign? That would be way back in 1992-93, when Gary Roberts achieved the feat.</p>, <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right up there with the best playmakers, if not <em>The Best</em>, in our opinion,\u201d said Giordano of Gaudreau. \u201cHe sees the game extremely well, two or three steps ahead of most of us. He\u2019s just been great this year, all year. Dynamic. He\u2019s one of those guys that every time he gets into the offensive zone, it feels like something is going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>That, Peters has learned, is not just because of Gaudreau\u2019s creativity or sky-high skill level.</p>, <p>Competitiveness is a key ingredient, too.</p>, <p>\u201cEvery night, it\u2019s on display in some regard,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be his size and go in and win those battles that he does. And he wins them in different fashion. He wins them with hockey sense. He wins them by being quick. He out-thinks his opponent \u2026 \u201d</p>, <p>The coach continued, referencing Gaudreau\u2019s sensational setup on Lindholm\u2019s strike against the San Jose Sharks on New Year\u2019s Eve, when No. 13 slammed on his brakes and plattered a cross-seam feed as his linemate cruised into the slot.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a two-on-two, and he makes a world-class pass that ends up with a guy receiving it right in the wheelhouse with an empty net, and the goaltender has to go east-west,\u201d Peters marvelled. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a pass.\u201d</p>, <p>A hell of a player, too.</p>, <p>Off to the all-star weekend again, and deservedly so.</p>, <p><a href="mailto:wgilbertson@postmedia.com">wgilbertson@postmedia.com</a></p>, <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wesgilbertson">Twitter.com/WesGilbertson</a></p>, <p>Stories, pictures and tributes to life.

Let\u2019s also not forget that the Dodgers have cleared some payroll (and an outfield roster spot) by trading away <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/puigya01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Yasiel Puig</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kempma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Matt Kemp</a>.</p>, <p>You can never count out Washington based off the team's history and how Boras has dealt directly with ownership. However, it\u2019s hard to think the Dodgers aren\u2019t going to try and make a push for the former NL MVP, despite their reported desire for a right-handed impact hitter. Then, of course, there\u2019s always the Phillies, who have money burning in their pocket and are going to have a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/report-phillies-face-face-meeting-bryce-harper-194519218.html" target="_blank">face-to-face meeting</a> with Harper soon.</p>, <p>At this point, it seems most likely that Philly will land him based on the circumstances, but anything can happen.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/machama01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Manny Machado</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Similar to Harper \u2014 and a number of other top free agents we\u2019ll talk about \u2014 <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2018/11/27/mlb-hot-stove-evaluating-manny-machados-potential-free-agent-landing-spots-cmb11/" target="_blank">we previously went into detail</a> with regard to Machado\u2019s potential suitors. Since then, the infielder\u2019s known market has seemingly been focused around the three above teams he visited following the Winter Meetings.</p>, <p>Despite being on the verge of officially signing <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tulowtr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Troy Tulowitzki</a> and probably <a href="https://twitter.com/martinonyc/status/1080590702495649792" target="_blank">not offering Machado the most money</a>, the Yankees still appear to be the front-runner.</p>, <p>New York is clearly preparing for a scenario where Machado doesn\u2019t choose it, and if he does, it gives the Yankees plenty of options while <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gregodi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Didi Gregorius</a> is on the disabled list \u2014 including floating <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/andujmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Miguel Andujar</a> in trade talks.</p>, <p>The Phillies are <a href="https://twitter.com/BNightengale/status/1080895263470829569" target="_blank">expected to be the highest bidder</a> for both Harper and Machado, so we\u2019ll see how everything plays out soon enough.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/keuchda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Dallas Keuchel</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Angels, Milwaukee Brewers, Texas Rangers, Houston Astros</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>You\u2019ll be shocked to know that we\u2019ve also looked at Keuchel\u2019s <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2018/12/19/dallas-keuchel-rumors-evaluating-free-agent-landing-spots-cmb11/" target="_blank">possible landing spots</a>. However, things may start to pick up since the southpaw now appears to be the best available starter left on the market.</p>, <p>The Reds just feel like such a perfect fit. They\u2019re tired of losing and have been aggressive with regard to making offseason upgrades. Even with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/woodal02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Alex Wood</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/roarkta01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Tanner Roark</a> now in the rotation, they still have a number of question marks. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=castilu02,castilu01,castil014lui,castil018lui,castil015lui&amp;search=Luis+Castillo&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Luis Castillo</a> had an up-and-down sophomore campaign, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/desclan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Anthony DeSclafani</a>\n<a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/01/01/fantasy-baseball-six-mlb-starting-pitchers-with-a-lot-to-prove-in-2019-cmb11/5/" target="_blank">has a lot to prove</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mahlety01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Tyler Mahle</a> has struggled with his command through his first 132 big-league innings.</p>, <p>While it\u2019d also be intriguing to see the Brewers make a serious pursuit, that might only happen if the Boras client\u2019s asking price lowers. For a team that was just one win away from the World Series this past October, the Brewers also have a number of varying rotation question marks. Between <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nelsoji02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Jimmy Nelson</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/woodrbr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Brandon Woodruff</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/anderch01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Chase Anderson</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davieza02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Zach Davies</a>, Milwaukee could use a little certainty. Keuchel can provide that \u2014 he\u2019s tossed 200-plus innings three times since 2014 and has accumulated fewer than 150 frames in a season once since becoming a full-time big-league starter in 2013.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kimbrcr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Craig Kimbrel</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Yes, we also looked at Craig Kimbrel\u2019s <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2018/12/04/mlb-free-agency-evaluating-craig-kimbrels-landing-spots-cmb11/" target="_blank">possible landing spots</a> in a more in-depth post, but this is the last one, we promise. While it\u2019s clear to see which teams could use a reliever of his caliber, his record-breaking asking price is what\u2019s really holding up his market.</p>, <p>That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re looking for a six-year guarantee around $100 million.</p>, <p>The Phillies made sense due to their ability to spend, but they may no longer be interested after agreeing to a two-year, $23 million deal with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/roberda08.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">David Robertson</a>. The Cardinals were a speculative fit earlier in the winter, but they also pivoted to <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=millean01,miller014and,miller011and&amp;search=Andrew+Miller&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Andrew Miller</a>.</p>, <p>Kimbrel\u2019s best bet may be lowering his asking price significantly and going back to the Red Sox. Without a real clear market and sky-high contract demands, this could become a wait-and-see situation that feels a lot like the <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/martijd02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">J.D. Martinez</a> situation from last winter.</p>, <p>Boston was interested in Robertson but didn\u2019t bite on the guarantee he received from Philly. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how long Kimbrel has to wait for a deal to materialize and how far below his original asking price it seems like he\u2019ll fall.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/grandya01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Yasmani Grandal</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Houston Astros</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Yasmani Grandal\u2019s market has taken some time to crystallize because of the non-stop <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/realmjt01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">J.T. Realmuto</a> rumors. Despite the Miami Marlins\u2019 high asking price, he\u2019s clearly the crown jewel when it comes to catcher acquisitions based on how things have played out thus far.</p>, <p>As for Grandal\u2019s immediate future, a number of the teams currently connected to him don\u2019t make sense unless his contract demands crater. The Indians have been slashing payroll while trying to stay competitive, so that\u2019s not a fit at a multi-year guarantee. The A\u2019s probably won\u2019t be filling their catching need at the top of the market, either. Heck, they just lost <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lucrojo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Jonathan Lucroy</a> via free agency, who signed for less than $4 million with the Angels.</p>, <p>The Astros have <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chiriro01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Robinson Chirinos</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stassma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Max Stassi</a> on their roster, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from pursuing Realmuto. And Grandal\u2019s most recent employer, the Dodgers, aren\u2019t interested in re-signing him for more than one year.</p>, <p>That leaves the White Sox, who have a ton of financial flexibility, are interested in making progress in their rebuild, and have made subtle upgrades by acquiring <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/novaiv01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Ivan Nova</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/alonsyo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Yonder Alonso</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/colomal01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Alex Colome</a>. They\u2019ve also signed <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mccanja02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">James McCann</a> to pair with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/castiwe01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Welington Castillo</a> behind the plate, but neither is a huge financial burden if they decide to switch gears.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/polloaj01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>A.J. Pollock</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?\xa0</p>, <p>This is another situation that\u2019s a bit cloudy because of both Pollock\u2019s asking price (around five years and $80 million), along with being behind the big domino (Harper) that needs to fall first.</p>, <p>The Reds still need a center fielder after non-tendering <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=hamilbi02,hamilbi01&amp;search=Billy+Hamilton&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Billy Hamilton</a>, but they\u2019ve already invested a lot of money into the outfield with the acquisitions of Puig and Kemp. The Mets look like the most logical fit based on need since <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cespeyo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Yoenis Cespedes</a>\u2018 health is up in the air and the only natural center fielder on the 40-man roster being <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lagarju01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Juan Lagares</a>.</p>, <p>While the Mets were sincerely interested in Pollock (and probably still are), a pairing here probably will happen unless the oft-injured 31-year-old eases on his contract demands. If not, there\u2019s space on the roster and in the payroll for him with the White Sox.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gonzama01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Marwin Gonzalez</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Angels, New York Mets, basically any contender</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Trying to pin down Gonzalez\u2019s market is also tough, but that\u2019s because \u201cSwiss G\u201d could fit on just about any club\u2019s roster. He\u2019d be an interesting fit in San Diego, as he could hold shortstop warm for <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=tatis-003fer" target="_blank">Fernando Tatis Jr.</a> and then move elsewhere when he gets promoted, but it\u2019s hard to shake off the Nats here.</p>, <p>Washington surely has no problem spending money, and the Nats have a need at second base. However, it\u2019s reported that their preference is to <a href="https://theathletic.com/736074/2018/12/31/the-9-pressing-questions-for-the-nationals/" target="_blank">find a solution</a> on a short-term deal so prospect <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=kieboo000car&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Carter Kieboom</a> isn\u2019t blocked. Gonzalez, a Boras client, will definitely get a multi-year guarantee, so one might imagine heading to D.C. is out of the cards.</p>, <p>But maybe not. Gonzalez could play second base in 2019, and if the Nats can\u2019t retain third baseman <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rendoan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Anthony Rendon</a> (another Boras client), Marwin could shift over to the hot corner. Or, he could slide over to first base since <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=zimmery01,zimmer006rya,zimmer004rya&amp;search=Ryan+Zimmerman&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Ryan Zimmerman</a> is approaching the final year of his current contract.</p>, <p>Versatility with the glove is a wonderful thing.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brittza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Zach Britton</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>With Robertson finding a home in Philly, Britton may now <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1080894191469768704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mlb.com%2Fnews%2Fzach-britton-rumors%2Fc-301737818" target="_blank">be the next top reliever</a> to sign a contract. He hasn\u2019t re-created the dominant two-year stretch he had with the Baltimore Orioles from 2015-16 (1.22 ERA, 0.91 WHIP, 30.2 percent strikeout rate, 6.2 percent walk rate and 83 saves in 132.2 innings), but he\u2019s still a solid and proven veteran option for the back end of any bullpen.</p>, <p>With the Phillies likely out of the picture, this could come down to being a good, old-fashioned fight between the Red Sox and Yankees. Although Boston might be more interested in waiting out Kimbrel, it could offer Britton an opportunity to close again. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chapmar01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Aroldis Chapman</a>\u2018s presence doesn\u2019t give the Yankees the luxury of offering that, but Britton has already mentioned he\u2019d take a <a href="https://www.nj.com/yankees/2018/10/zach_britton_why_im_open_to_lesser_role_re-signing.html" target="_blank">lesser bullpen role</a> to return to the Bronx.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/ottavad01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Adam Ottavino</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, Colorado Rockies</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Ottavino picked the perfect time to have a career year. He posted personal bests in ERA (2.43), hard-hit rate allowed (25.3 percent), strikeout rate (36.3 percent) and fWAR (2.0) while drastically cutting down his homers allowed per nine innings (0.58) in 77.2 innings for the Rockies last season.</p>, <p>Colorado is open to retaining him, but it's already invested a ton into <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/daviswa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Wade Davis</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgeeja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Jake McGee</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shawbr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Bryan Shaw</a>. So who knows how much more flexibility the Rockies have to invest in the bullpen moving forward.</p>, <p>There\u2019s a fair amount of overlap in potential suitors for Britton and Ottavino, and for good reason. It\u2019s likely that their eventual landing spots may depend on who signs first. The wild card here could be the White Sox, as they have plenty of space in the payroll to outbid others if they really want to acquire the 33-year-old right-hander to pair with Colome.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lowrije01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank"><strong>Jed Lowrie</strong></a></p>, <p>Suitors: Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox</p>, <p>Best fit(s)?</p>, <p>Lowrie has put together consecutive stellar (and nearly identical) campaigns with the Oakland A\u2019s after struggling in 2016. What\u2019s tricky for the veteran second baseman is that he\u2019s looking for a multi-year commitment as he enters his age-35 season.</p>, <p>The Nats and Brewers would both be interesting fits because they\u2019re likely contenders with openings at second base. At this point in the winter, it\u2019s possible Lowrie would eventually settle for a two-year deal, allowing Washington and Milwaukee to not block their respective up-and-coming second-base prospects.</p>, <p>How fun would it be for the Rockies to make a splash here, though? Their offense has struggled mightily over the past two years, and they just made a significant upgrade by signing <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/murphda08.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">Daniel Murphy</a> for two years. He\u2019ll slide into first base, still leaving second open due to <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lemahdj01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank">DJ LeMahieu</a>\u2018s free agency.

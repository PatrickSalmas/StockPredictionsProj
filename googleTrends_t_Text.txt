The rover is now programmed to roam across a barren vista toward a distinct crater.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Chinese scientists hailed the landing of the Chang\u2019e-4 probe as evidence of the country\u2019s growing stature in space exploration. \u201cIt is human nature to explore the unknown world,\u201d Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar mission for the China National Space Administration, said in an interview on the state television network, CCTV. \u201cAnd it is what our generation and the next generation are supposed to do.\u201d</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Compared with previous missions, however, the reaction to Thursday\u2019s milestones seemed strikingly restrained, both in the country\u2019s state-run news outlets and on social media. On China\u2019s most-watched TV news program early Thursday evening, the landing \u2014 declared a success by officials at mission control \u2014 was not even one of the four top stories.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">The doodle of China\u2019s biggest search engine, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.baidu.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Baidu</a>, paid subtle homage to the lander and its rover, but the news was relegated to the fifth item on CCTV\u2019s 7 p.m. news program.

But the coverage also appeared to reflect political and economic anxieties at a time when Mr. Xi\u2019s government is trying to negotiate a truce in the trade war with the United States and respond to worrisome cracks in the economy.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">A woman in a cafe in Beijing, Liu Ying, expressed pride in the space program but said she had not followed the landing closely. She then expressed wonder about the costs. \u201cThe economy is bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it really a good thing for the country to spend recklessly?\u201d</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">The government does not disclose how much it spends on its space programs, but it has made it clear that this launch was part of an ambitious goal to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/world/asia/china-space-moon.html?module=inline" title="">establish China as one of the world\u2019s space powers</a>, rivaling the United States. Officials have said the country hopes to establish a lunar base that could provide natural resources for the Earth but also serve as a launching pad for further exploration.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">The first of three photographs sent by Chang\u2019e-4 appeared a little over an hour after the spacecraft <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/world/asia/china-change-4-moon.html?module=inline" title="">touched down</a> as planned at 10:26 a.m., Beijing time, in the middle of a crater not far from the moon\u2019s south pole.

The other two, in black and white, showed the lander descending.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">The spacecraft was the first to land intact on the side of the moon that perpetually faces away from Earth. A Soviet satellite took the first photographs of the far side in 1959, and the Apollo missions circled above it between 1968 and 1972, but the difficulty of communicating with earthbound scientists had always made the idea of landing there more complex, if not necessarily prohibitive.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Dr. Wu, in his televised remarks, said the landing had been a \u201cgreat kickoff\u201d for future lunar missions, including ones intended to land astronauts \u2014 something only the United States has accomplished, sending 12 men to the moon. Under the current schedule, China would send the first astronaut by 2030.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">\u201cWe are building China into a space giant,\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">To overcome the challenge of communicating from the moon\u2019s far side, China had previously launched a satellite called Queqiao, or Magpie Bridge. It now orbits beyond the moon to act as a relay for transmissions to and from the mission control center on the northwestern outskirts of Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">China\u2019s first lunar probe, known as Chang\u2019e-3, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/asia/china-lands-probe-on-the-moon-report-says.html?module=inline" title="">landed on the near side of the moon in 2013</a>. It also released a rover, but it was hindered by terrain and communication problems. After a month it came to a halt, and broadcast only intermittently following that.</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">Yu Guobin, a spokesman for the Chang\u2019e-4 program, said in televised remarks that the detachment of the rover was the \u201cmore important historical moment.\u201d</p>, <p class="css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0">NASA\u2019s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, congratulated his Chinese counterparts for the successful landing.

[<p>While flying by Jupiter in late December 2018, NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft captured <a class="E" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190102112852.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new pictures of volcanic plumes on Jupiter\u2019s moon</a> Io. The pictures are being touted by scientists as \u201cone of the best images of Io\u201d Juno\u2019s cameras have captured to date. Happy new year! Look at some cool pictures of volcanoes 365 million miles away from Earth!</p>, <p>The images were taken on Dec. 21, during winter solstice. During the spacecraft\u2019s 17th flyby of the planet, four of Juno\u2019s cameras took images of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, which a <a class="E" href="https://www.swri.org/press-release/light-from-volcanoes-io-juno-jupiter-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from Southwest Research Institute calls \u201cthe most volcanic body in our solar system.\u201d Io\u2019s volcanoes were initially discovered by NASA's Voyager spacecraft almost 40 years ago, in 1979. However, these newest pictures are giving scientists a clearer image of the the volcanic activity on Io.</p>, <p>\u201cWe knew we were breaking new ground with a multi-spectral campaign to view Io\u2019s polar region, but no one expected we would get so lucky as to see an active volcanic plume shooting material off the moon's surface,\u201d Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission and an associate vice president of Southwest Research Institute\u2019s Space Science and Engineering Division, said in the press release. \u201cThis is quite a New Year\u2019s present showing us that Juno has the ability to clearly see plumes.\u201d</p>, <p>That settles it: 2019 is the year of volcanic plumes. </p>, <p>Juno observed Jupiter\u2019s moon for over an hour, capturing the images which show evidence of an active eruption. To the non-scientific eye, the above photo may just look like darkness, blurry light, bits of yellow and orange. However, as the press release explains, there\u2019s actually a lot going on in the picture: \u201cThe brightest feature on Io in the image is thought to be a penetrating radiation signature, a reminder of this satellite's role in feeding Jupiter's radiation belts, while other features show the glow of activity from several volcanoes\u201d</p>, <p>Why was Juno able to capture the volcanic activity? In part, because they\u2019re illuminated by the nearby moon Europa. In part, because of just how big the plumes are. As Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, the JunoCam lead from the Planetary Science Institute, explains, \u201cThe ground is already in shadow, but the height of the plume allows it to reflect sunlight, much like the way mountaintops or clouds on the Earth continue to be lit after the sun has set.\u201d </p>, <p>Those two things combined with Juno\u2019s low-light cameras made for an ideal opportunity to capture these new images. \u201cAs a low-light camera designed to track the stars, the SRU can only observe Io under very dimly lit conditions,\u201d Heidi Becker, lead of Juno's Radiation Monitoring Investigation, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. said. \u201cDec. 21 gave us a unique opportunity to observe Io's volcanic activity with the SRU using only Europa's moonlight as our lightbulb.\u201d </p>, <p>Basically, ideal lighting and good timing are to thank for these now-historic pictures.</p>, <p>Juno launched in 2011 and first arrived at Jupiter in 2016. The craft is now halfway through its mission, with scientists aiming Juno to complete its map of Jupiter by mid-2021. \u201cThough Jupiter's moons are not JIRAM's primary objectives, every time we pass close enough to one of them, we take advantage of the opportunity for an observation,\u201d Alberto Adriani, a researcher at Italy's National Institute of Astrophysics, said. \u201cThe instrument is sensitive to infrared wavelengths, which are perfect to study the volcanism of Io. This is one of the best images of Io that JIRAM has been able to collect so far.\u201d</p>, <p>So, what does this all mean to us earthbound beings? For starters, These new images will also help scientists better understand how Jupiter interacts with its five moons and the phenomena it causes, like Io\u2019s volcanoes.</p>, <p>If planetary meanings are your thing, perhaps you could look into <a class="E" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-it-mean-if-jupiter-is-in-sagittarius-this-planet-brings-good-luck-to-all-zodiac-signs-13206069">how Jupiter affects your zodiac sign</a>. The giant gas planet is moving into Sagittarius, which is thought to bring good luck. There was certainly a bit of good cosmic timing in play when Juno captured its latest pictures.</p>]

[<p>2018 was a quiet year for Olympus, but the Micro Four Thirds company will start 2019 with the launch of what appears to be a high-end camera geared toward sports photographers. Olympus released a teaser video for an unnamed OM-D camera with a launch date of January 24.</p>, <p>The 18-second teaser reveals little about the upcoming camera save for a few glimpses of the body and the situations in which it\u2019s apparently meant to excel. While the camera is unnamed, the video does end on the OM-D logo, suggesting it could be a replacement to the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/digital-camera-reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-ii-review/">OM-D E-M1 Mark II</a> that\u2019s going on three years old.</p>, <p>A silhouette of the camera shows a body that appears to be a bit taller than a typical OM-D or has a battery grip accessory attached. But what perhaps offers more clues to the new OM-D is <i>where</i> the camera is. The teaser shows the camera shooting at several different sports events, including football, beach volleyball, and water polo, suggesting the camera is geared for sports action. This may also suggest professional level dust- and splash-proofing, something Olympus is already well known for.</p>, <p>While Panasonic, Nikon,\xa0and Canon announced full-frame mirrorless cameras last year, <a href="https://camerajabber.com/olympus-full-frame-is-good-for-micro-four-thirds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interviews with Olympus executives suggest</a> Olympus isn\u2019t planning on ditching the Micro Four Thirds format. The camera body certainly appears to be large enough to support a larger sensor, but sticking with Four Thirds would make sense. The smaller format smaller and lighter lenses, making extreme telephoto lenses easier to carry, which would certainly be welcome in sports photography.</p>, <p>Last year, Olympus had few product launches, with the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/digital-camera-reviews/olympus-pen-e-pl9-review/">beginner-friendly E-PL9</a>\xa0being its most prominent. The company\u2019s OM-D line, on the other hand, is typically more pro-oriented. While more companies continue to push for higher resolution, larger sensors, Olympus\u2019 past launches have focused on other technologies, like image stabilization and advanced shooting modes, like Pro Capture and the High-Resolution Shot.</p>, <p>2019 also marks Olympus\u2019 100th anniversary \u2014 an important product launch would be a good way to mark the occasion. Olympus has <a href="https://www.getolympus.com/us/en/omdrevolution?SID=ifqpkeiqlbrf0mr8lhh8hmaui2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a countdown to the launch set on its website</a>, along with an email sign-up to receive more details.</p>]
[<p>University of Maryland researchers have given Google a "welcome to 2019" gift by breaking its latest reCaptcha audio challenge.</p>, <p>The work is a follow-up to <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/31/uncaptcha_research_cracks_audio_captchas/" target="_blank">an attack</a> published in April 2017 by the university's Kevin Bock, Daven Patel, George Hughey and Dave Levin, again attacking the audio challenges. Since then, Google has updated the code, and the boffins have updated their attack.</p>, <p>The audio challenge was created to solve reCaptcha's accessibility problem \u2013 someone using a screen reader can't see where to "tick the box" to prove they aren't a robot.</p>, <p>The 2017 attack, documented <a href="http://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>, downloaded and segmented the audio captcha, sent the segments on to multiple online speech-to-text services, checked the responses for homophones, applied a weighted vote to those responses, and uploaded the answer to reCaptcha.</p>, <p>They claimed better than 85 per cent accuracy for that attack, and when Google fixed reCaptcha's audio challenge, the group set to work attacking the replacement. They demonstrated that the fixes made reCaptcha less secure, told Google in June 2018 (with a six-month disclosure deadline), and on Monday <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2" target="_blank">published</a> unCaptcha2.</p>, <p>The group said: "Thanks to the changes to the audio challenge, [parsing] ReCaptcha is easier than ever before.

[<p>You\u2019ll see a theme if you scroll back the last decade or so on <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MO</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: we have a thing for the Triumph Street Triple. After numerous rides and shootouts each time it gets updated, it\u2019s safe to say we love that little 675cc three-cylinder. The sound it makes is outrageously cool, the power it delivers is fun without being overwhelming, and the overall package is an absolute blast. Yeah, the looks are kinda polarizing, but none of that matters once you twist the grip.</span></p>, <p id="galleryPlayer_1"><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">Get the Flash Player</a> to see this player.</p>, <p>Then, lo-and-behold, Triumph one-upped itself and upgraded the Street Triple at the end of 2017 as a 2018 model, giving it a significant bump in displacement: up to 765cc \u2013 much to the grins of dyslexics everywhere. Of course, the magic of three cylinders didn\u2019t go anywhere, and the new bike was once again a hit amongst us all. Tom \u201cBiceps\u201d Roderick seriously considered buying one when he walked out the proverbial <i>MO</i> door on his way to self-employment. Meanwhile, we all liked it enough to name it <a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/mobos/best-standard-motorcycle-2018.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorcycle.com\u2019s Best Standard Motorcycle of 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And by \u201cit\u201d I\u2019m talking about Triumph\u2019s top-of-the-range RS version of the Street Triple. Contenders for the Streetie\u2019s crown have come and gone, and while some have done better than others at swaying our opinion, at the end of the day our hearts have always gravitated back to the Triumph. </span></p>, <p>KTM\u2019s response? \u201cChallenge accepted.\u201d</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">\u201cI see your Street Triple R, and I raise you this.\u201d -KTM</p>, <p>Okay, we seriously doubt this was actually said inside some KTM board meeting (although it\u2019d be great if it were), but when it comes to benchmarking an existing model for KTM\u2019s new 799cc parallel-Twin, Team Orange couldn\u2019t have picked a better target. Of course, we all know the result: the 790 Duke. Our European friends got to taste the Orange kool-aid a year before we did, but when Evans came back from his <a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/ktm/2019-ktm-790-duke-review-first-ride.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">790 Duke First Ride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he really loved it \u2013 as in, he was thinking of ways to buy one without pissing off his wife. Naturally, our response was to put the KTM head-to-head with the Triumph to see if our favorite little Triple could hold off yet another challenger. If you need detailed overviews of each bike, click on the links above for a breakdown.</span></p>, <p>Naturally, we do our best to keep comparisons as fair as possible, and the basis of this starts with price. The 790 Duke only comes in one flavor with pricing set at $10,499. With that, you get a potent 799cc parallel-Twin \u2013 which, as you should know by now, is a first for KTM \u2013 pumping out 98.0 hp and 60.2 lb-ft to the rear wheel on the MotoGP Werks dyno. Accompanying the Twin is an electronics suite featuring adjustable (and switchable) traction control, ABS, power modes, and best of all, a quickshifter in both directions. Brakes are twin 300mm discs with J.Juan radial-mount 4-pot calipers in the front, 240mm single disc and one-pot J.Juan caliper in the back. WP handles suspension duties (pun not intended), but cheaps out a bit offering a non-adjustable 43mm fork and a shock with just preload settings available.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">If you look strictly at the numbers, the Triumph wins the horsepower war. Look closer and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s only after the KTM signs off that the Street Triple gets its advantage.</p>, <p>The Street Triple, however, comes in a variety of flavors, from the $9,950 S model on up to the $12,550 RS. While the latter gets all the bells and whistles like a quickshifter (only for upshifts), five ride modes, Brembo M50 calipers, \xd6hlins shock, and the most power in the range \u2013 a claimed 121 hp and 57 lb-ft \u2013 the price moves it rather far away from the KTM, especially considering the Triumph also comes in an R version starting at $11,250 \u2013 much more in line with the 790. For that price, the R gets Brembo M4.32 calipers, Showa Big Piston fork and adjustable shock, four ride modes (no Track mode), full TFT instrumentation, and slightly less power than the RS \u2013 ours put down 114.9 hp and 56.7 lb-ft to the wheel, according to the MotoGP Werks dyno.</p>, <p>However, things aren\u2019t always as perfect as they seem, since we were sent the R model in the Matt Aluminum Silver color, adding $250 extra, for a total of $11,500. A whole thousand bucks more than the KTM. To confuse matters that much more, the base Street Triple S version starts at $9,950 and moves up to $10,200. While that may be the closest from a cost perspective, the S model is slightly detuned from the R (which is already a little down to the RS), only gets two riding modes, lower-spec Showa suspension, and basic pin-slide two-piston Nissin brakes. Neither the R or S gets a quickshifter, but going on cost and which features most closely line up, we opted for the Street Triple R to face the 790 Duke.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">The picture looks even worse for the Triumph in the torque department, where the KTM has its number. Just look at that advantage in the midrange \u2013 although the Triumph\u2019s fueling does look much cleaner.</p>, <p>The procedure is fairly simple from here: we flog them on the street, then rinse and repeat at the track, joining our friends at <a href="https://www.rickdiculousracing.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickdiculous Racing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a day at Chuckwalla. Keeping with the apples-to-apples theme, we spooned each bike with </span><a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/products/dunlop-sportmax-q4-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunlop\u2019s Q4 tire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We did this for a few reasons. First, the Q4 is a track-focused tire for the road rider, meaning it can handle street riding just fine, but it also heats up quickly for track use without the need for warmers \u2013 perfect for us lazy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MO</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rons who don\u2019t want to bother with slapping blankets on tires after each session. Second, and maybe more importantly, the standard tires on our test Triumph were already squared off in the center from a previous user. That would have impacted handling severely and unfairly against the ST765. \xa0</span></p>, <p>Considering my time aboard the <a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/kramer/world-exclusive-kramer-gp2-prototype-first-ride.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kramer GP2 Prototype</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, powered by the same 799cc Twin as the KTM, I was anxious to see how the 790 Duke would perform. Joining me on this flog-a-thon is none other than \u201cBiceps\u201d Roderick, coaxed out of semi-retirement by the call of a wailing Triple and a burbling Twin (and the offer of a free breakfast). But since he was on the verge of actually buying a Street Triple, Tom was the perfect candidate.</span></p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">We opted to run the Dunlop Q4 tires on both bikes for a few reasons, but mainly because we didn\u2019t want to use tire warmers at the racetrack.</p>, <p>Looking at the specs (and considering our past experience), on paper the Triumph appeared to be better of the two. With three cylinders, more power, and only a nine-pound weight difference on the official <em>MO</em> scales (420 lbs vs. 411 for the KTM), both Tom and I had a hard time imagining the Triumph losing. Out on the road, the Streetie exhibited all of its lovable character, too. The three-cylinder wail is as intoxicating as ever, and now that it has more displacement, the extra shove when you twist your wrist adds to the excitement factor. Not having a quickshifter was a bit of a drag, but that\u2019s a first-world problem if ever there were one. The Streetie shifts just fine if you know what you\u2019re doing, and the slipper clutch does a great job of keeping the rear in check if you don\u2019t. Adjustable levers and an informative TFT display, including gear indicator, are also a nice touch.</p>, <p>If the specs and the dyno numbers were all we needed to determine these tests, then our job would be incredibly easy (and boring). Sometimes though, the magic can\u2019t be found on a piece of paper. This is the beauty of the KTM 790 Duke. Despite what the numbers say, both Tom and I fell for the 790 instantly. KTM dubs the bigger 1290 Super Duke R \u201cThe Beast\u201d and this, the 790 Duke, \u201cThe Scalpel\u201d \u2013 and after riding it, the name definitely fits. The smaller Duke takes the attitude of the big, burly 1290 and refines it to a precision-like quality with the 790.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-93713" height="388" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" src="https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-633x388.jpg" srcset="https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-633x388.jpg 633w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-315x193.jpg 315w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-768x471.jpg 768w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-75x46.jpg 75w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-120x74.jpg 120w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-150x93.jpg 150w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-186x114.jpg 186w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-210x128.jpg 210w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-224x137.jpg 224w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-270x165.jpg 270w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-408x250.jpg 408w, https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/010219-2019-KTM-790-Duke-Triumph-Street-Triple-Group-Action_EBB6291-637x390.jpg 637w" width="633"/></a></p>, <p>Despite having one less cylinder than the Triumph, Tom was convinced this is \u201cprobably one of the best parallel-twin engines ever! The Trumpet may make more peak horsepower, but look for yourself at the dyno chart and see how the KTM\u2019s Twin romps the Triumph\u2019s Triple from 3,100 rpm to 9,100 rpm in horsepower production, while also producing significantly more torque through the same rev range. And the dyno data can be felt in the real world whether on the street or at the track.\u201d</p>, <p>This is the secret sauce behind the KTM. While the Triumph makes more power, it\u2019s only after the KTM hits redline that the 765 Triple shines, meaning you have to wind it up to keep chase. At Chuckwalla this wasn\u2019t much of an issue, since you naturally keep engines singing at the track \u2013 and in fact the Triumph easily kept the KTM in its dust when it came to outright speed. But when you\u2019re cruising the street or even playing in the canyons, the broad spread of power from the Duke is easier to tap into.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">The heart of the KTM 790 Duke is this 799cc parallel-Twin engine that punches way above its weight.</p>, <p>Of course, since the KTM has a smaller rev window compared to the Triumph, you also have to shift more. Not a problem, since the Duke not only has a quickshifter, but it works for both up- and down-shifts \u2013 not bad for $10,5K. That said, the QS isn\u2019t the slickest system in the world. Downshifts are a little clunky at times, and if I really wanted to go from sixth to third quickly I\u2019d resort to using the clutch. Still, it\u2019s nice to have.</p>, <p>\u201cEqually impressive to its power production is the KTM\u2019s handling,\u201d Tom says. \u201cEager to get leaned into a corner, the KTM holds its trajectory and absorbs road imperfections surprisingly well for a bike with non-adjustable suspension units.\u201d It\u2019s true. Despite its basic suspension bits, we never found ourselves eagerly wishing to adjust settings at either end on the KTM, even at the track. Could they be better? Sure, slightly stiffer springs and/or increased damping wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">When given room to stretch its legs, the KTM only gets smaller in the Triumph\u2019s mirrors.</p>, <p>The biggest surprise by far is how each motorcycle carries its weight. As T-Rod explains, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t translate from paper to real world is the KTM\u2019s seemingly minor nine-pound weight advantage. I\u2019m still scratching my head at how KTM managed to make the 790 Duke feel 50 pounds lighter than the Street Triple. Whatever magic combination of CoG, rake, trail and wheelbase numbers works so well I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not butter.\u201d</p>, <p>As if this test didn\u2019t bring us a few surprises already, what continually left us floored was how much lighter the 790 feels. It\u2019s worth saying it again \u2013 the KTM is only nine pounds lighter than the Triumph \u2013 but whether on the street or the track, hustling each bike from side to side was dramatically different. The Street Triple feels slow and lethargic (words we\u2019d never otherwise use to describe the ST) compared to the quickness and agility of the 790 Duke. It\u2019s otherworldly.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">Screw what the scales say. You really need to ride the two back-to-back to understand how much lighter the KTM feels compared to the Triumph.</p>, <p>On the electronics front, both are equipped with TC and ABS. At the track, both ABS systems intervene earlier than prefered, the Triumph especially so, leading me to shut them off. The Duke does come with a Supermoto ABS setting, letting you lock the rear wheel to your heart\u2019s content. That said, Tom and I are split about which brakes we prefer. Personally, I lean towards the feel and power of the Triumph\u2019s Brembos while Tom\u2019s on the KTM\u2019s side. The TC nod also goes to the KTM, as it\u2019s adjustable to different levels, and performs remarkably well at putting the power down without too much distraction to the rider. Once slip is noticed on the Street Triple R, power is cut dramatically. And there\u2019s only on or off, no selecting of different levels.</p>, <p>Turning our attention away from flogging and onto slogging \u2013 as in, casual riding \u2013 things look a little better for the Triumph. First, \u201cthe Triumph has a much cushier seat compared to the KTM\u2019s flat, densely-cushioned pad,\u201d says Tom. \u201cBut the extra legroom on the Duke and more upright riding position kept me happier during freeway riding.\u201d Personally, I appreciated the KTM\u2019s extra legroom, but the upright seating position left me feeling like a sail on the highway. Without any wind protection, I preferred the Triumph\u2019s slight forward lean to help offset the windblast.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">If the KTM 790 Duke didn\u2019t exist, we\u2019d continue to be singing the Triumph\u2019s praises. In fact, if we had the RS to play with our opinions might be different.</p>, <p>This is one of those rare times when we don\u2019t need the MO scorecard to pick a winner. If you\u2019ve read this far it should seem fairly obvious. It\u2019s just surprising to us that it happened with these bikes. At first, we thought the Triumph had an easy win lined up for itself. Turns out the reality was entirely different. Let Tom clarify:</p>, <p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to complain about when it comes to the Triumph. It\u2019s still the same excellent motorcycle with all qualities we love that catapulted it to the top of MO\u2019s 2018 Best Standard category. It\u2019s only when ridden back-to-back with the Duke that it becomes apparent how much heavier and lethargic the ST3 is compared to the new Duke. However, maybe I\u2019d change my tune if it were the RS model for $2,000 more.</i></p>, <p><i>For the $1k price difference, and considering all the other previously mentioned reasons, it\u2019s easy to chose the KTM over the Triumph. With the money saved a person can then go about upgrading the KTM\u2019s only real flaw (if you want to call it that) \u2014 it\u2019s non-adjustable suspension components.\u201d</i></p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">We have a new crush in the middleweight category. And it\u2019s Austrian.</p>]

Even worse to me than the blue \u201cnothing\u201d flavor is LaCroix coconut. It sounds like it should be tasty and satisfying, but in fact tastes like the tincture of suntan oil brewed over the La Brea tar pits. Every once in awhile I forget and will find a can laying around at work, and think, \u201coh, I should try this again.\u201d Every single time I regret this decision. A better descriptive name on this can than \u201cCoconut\u201d would be \u201cTropical Dirt.\u201d<br/></p>, <p>So I was somewhat understandably wary of another coconut flavor that recently crossed my desk, from the <a href="http://www.newyorkseltzer.com/" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.newyorkseltzer.com/', {metric25:1})" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original New York Seltzer Company</a>.

The orange tastes like a dreamsicle, and the coconut is what I wished the LaCroix coconut would have been. It\u2019s like a coconut cream pie in a can: creamy, sweet, and somehow completely indulgent when it doesn\u2019t have a single calorie or carb. (Even its more indulgent <a href="http://www.newyorkseltzer.com/classic/#1489553033976-9d2d6af2-c688" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.newyorkseltzer.com/classic/#1489553033976-9d2d6af2-c688', {metric25:1})" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vanilla Cream Soda</a> tastes like an <a href="https://thetakeout.com/whats-a-chocolate-egg-cream-1828711730" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://thetakeout.com/whats-a-chocolate-egg-cream-1828711730', {metric25:1})" rel="nofollow">egg cream</a>.) </p>, <p>As it\u2019s <a href="https://thetakeout.com/consider-dryuary-alcohol-free-january-1831342632" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://thetakeout.com/consider-dryuary-alcohol-free-january-1831342632', {metric25:1})" rel="nofollow">Dryuary</a>, and I am on my now-annual search for excellent non-alcoholic beverages, New York Seltzer would be at the top of my list, and its coconut flavor would be at the top of <em>that</em> list. Maybe with a splash of lemonade? A shot of mango juice? Sure, but it\u2019s also dessert-worthy enough on its own self, right out of the can, with solid coconut flavor that tastes more like a macaroon than soil from the inner layers of the earth.</p>, <p>Maybe this stems from my teenage past as a high school lifeguard, but there\u2019s something about coconut that evokes summer, spring break, and tropical climes, which makes the flavor a continual draw for me, beverage-wise\u2014especially during this bleak time of year. Short of a pi\xf1a colada (even a virgin pi\xf1a colada), Original New York Seltzer Coconut fits the bill perfectly, at a beverage height that LaCroix Coconut, stuck in its muddy tar pits, can only dream of reaching.</p>, <p class="author-bio__bio">Gwen Ihnat is deputy managing editor of The Takeout and a staff writer for The A.V.

[<p>As 2019 gets underway, we\u2019re beginning to see the flood of year-end sales statistics from automakers. We\u2019ll have a few 2018-in-review pieces coming, but right now our focus is on American muscle. The U.S. sales figures are in for the 2018 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/camaro/" target="_self">Chevrolet Camaro</a>, 2018 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mustang/" target="_self">Ford Mustang</a>, and 2018 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/challenger/" target="_self">Dodge Challenger</a>, and for one of these cars, the news is quite grim.</p>, <p>We\u2019ll lead with the sales leader, and that title\xa0goes once again to the Ford Mustang. The original Pony Car is still the favorite among U.S. buyers by a significant margin, with 75,842 \u2018Stangs sold for the year. 2018 was the first full year for the car\u2019s mid-cycle facelift, not to mention the launch of the new<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/227235/2019-mustang-bullitt-street-detroit/" target="_self"> Bullitt</a> but not all the news is good. Despite holding the top spot with ease, Mustang sales are actually down 7.4 percent compared to 2017.</p>, <p>We\u2019ve heard some disapproving comments from the Mustang community about the car\u2019s new front clip, or perhaps buyers are awaiting the new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/shelby-gt500/" target="_self">GT500</a> which will<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/280215/mustang-shelby-gt500-teaser/" target="_self"> debut in just a couple weeks</a> at the Detroit Auto Show. In any case, we suspect the year-over-year drop has the attention of Dearborn executives at the very least.</p>, <p>Also grabbing their attention \u2013 not to mention the high-level suits at FCA headquarters on the other side of Detroit in Auburn Hills \u2013 is Dodge Challenger sales. Despite a platform that\u2019s now a decade old, sales for the big muscle car are <em>up</em>. 66,716 Challengers found new homes last year, a rise of 3 percent compared to 2017. It\u2019s not much of an increase, but it\u2019s the only car among the three to post a year-over-year gain.</p>, <p>Credit<a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/" target="_self"> Dodge</a> for continually offering interesting packages to keep the old Challenger relevant among competition that\u2019s seen several major revisions in the same time frame.

Despite offering perhaps the best Pony Car among the three on this list, Camaro sales fell through the floor last year. Only 50,963 were sold, representing a <em>25 percent drop</em> from the previous year. Like the Mustang, the Camaro entered 2018 with a facelift but it was widely criticized \u2013 so much in fact that <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/" target="_self">Chevrolet</a> is<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/273007/2020-camaro-ss-facelift/" target="_self"> fast-tracking a new front fascia to production</a>.</p>, <p>That\u2019s too bad, because in our comparison tests we loved nearly everything about the Camaro versus the competition, especially its driving dynamics. Here\u2019s hoping the new front fascia brings buyers back to Chevy showrooms, or else the fabled car could disappear from the lineup completely as it did in 2002.</p>, <p><em><strong>Source:</strong> GM, Ford, FCA</em></p>, <p><strong>DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 3, 2019</strong>\xa0\u2013 Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) today reported its December 2018 U.S. sales results.

But in an age where few smartphone applications push the mobile experience forward, the company showed how AI enhancements can go well beyond the photo quality optimizations that have become widely implemented by leading smartphone vendors.</p>, <p><strong>Also:\xa0</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ai-chip-unicorn-that-is-about-to-revolutionize-everything-has-computational-graph-at-its-core/" target="_blank"><strong>The AI chip unicorn that's about to revolutionize everything</strong></a></p>, <p>The demonstrations -- promised to be only a hint of the kinds of wizardry AI can muster -- made some of the strongest cases to date about how <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-startup-petuum-aims-to-industrialize-machine-learning/" target="_blank">AI-based computations</a> can enhance the smartphone experience beyond the photo enhancement that has been one of the leading manifestations to date. Indeed, they began with the original cell phone application: Voice calls. By using AI to identify the voice of the speaker, a phone would be able to virtually eliminate any background noise from a call, be it some reserved office chatter or raucous city street noise. This capability extended far beyond that of even today's best noise cancelling and into the realm of noise elimination.</p>, <p>Another demonstration showed the ability to improve the focus and bokeh of a photo that had already been taken or to change it after the fact in a manner pioneered by the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-may-acquire-light-field-tech-company-lytro-for-vr-ar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first Lytro camera</a>. A third showed the ability to change the hair color on the fly of a woman swaying against a colorful background in a 60fps video or to replace that background on the fly in a way that would require a skilled video editor using sophisticated compositing software today.</p>, <p><strong>Also:\xa0</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-startup-gyrfalcon-spins-plethora-of-chips-for-machine-learning/" target="_blank"><strong>AI Startup Gyrfalcon spins plethora of chips for machine learning</strong></a></p>, <p>But what may be even more impressive than how effective these techniques are is how efficient they are, at least when it comes to hardware. Today's noise-cancelling techniques, for example, use multiple microphones in order to capture and muffle distractions such as jet engine noise that has seeped into the cabin. In contrast, the AI-driven noise reduction demonstrated by Qualcomm needed only one microphone. Similarly, while the kind of depth-sensing that enables tasks such as background blurring typically uses multiple cameras, the demonstrations that Qualcomm gave used just one. Google, of course, is already creating some of these effects with the Pixel 3's sole rear camera. Apple is as well on the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-xr/" target="_blank">iPhone XR</a>, although the company claims the two-camera approach on its iPhone XS phones produces better results.</p>, <p>All these applications highlight the ability of AI to recognize and isolate different kinds of media objects and then act on them to improve an experience. While the photo and video capabilities are far more visually compelling, the conversation noise elimination one represents the kind of utility that stands to dramatically improve smartphone usage scenarios for a broad base of users in a transformative way.</p>, <p><strong>Also:\xa0</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-startup-cornami-reveals-details-of-neural-net-chip/" target="_blank"><strong>AI Startup Cornami reveals details of neural net chip</strong></a></p>, <p>Of course, taking best advantage of them will only be possible with the latest, premium smartphone chips. And while that cost might be offset by some component savings, those components may have other applications that can't currently be addressed by the leading-edge technology. But for many cases, AI is poised not only to offer an alternative way of achieving everyday tasks, but addressing them in a way that other approaches simply can't match.</p>, <p><em>Disclaimer: This

From pro tornaments, to a high concurrent player count, <a href="//comicbook.com/category/cs-go">CS:GO</a> is a title meant to be played. When the team decided that the game should move to free-to-play status in addition to adding a battle royale mode, the community was mixed with their reactions. As it turns out, it was one of the best decisions the developers could have made. </p>, <p>Though the most recent charting of concurrent players doesn't beat out their all time high of 850,000, the December month since going free-to-play did peak at 746, 548, which was a notable increase from November's 546,031. Since the average peak last year was 300,000, the stark increase means that the move - despite controversial at first - was the right move to make.</p>, <p>When the game first moved to free-to-play status, the Steam page was review bombed almost instantaneously. When it was bombarded with over 14,000 negative reviews, many thought this could be the mark of a decline for the noteworthy game. Though we've only had a month to see past the initial change, it's good to see that the reaction to the game is back to being more level-headed versus a knee-jerk response to the big change. </p>, <p>With the new battle royale experience now available, there's a certain freshness to the game as well. According to Valve, <em>Danger Zone </em>offers a fast-paced online experience - taking on the Battle Royale genre by storm. Using the traditional mechanics and tactical gameplay that <a href="//comicbook.com/category/cs-go">CS:GO</a> is known for, <em>Danger Zone </em>challenges players to take what they know and use it in the ultimate battle for survival.</p>, <p>Here's what you need to know about the latest addition to the award-winning shooter:</p>, <p>Players will also have an arsenal available to them that are already familiar to <a href="/category/cs-go">CS:GO</a> players. From SMGs, to rifles - and of course the heavy artillery that the game is known for, this new experience may be different for the franchise but it will still have a familiar feel to it.</p>, <p>What do you think about Valve's decision to add in battle royale and go free-to-play?

[<p id="skip-link"> <a class="element-invisible element-focusable" href="#main-menu">Jump to navigation</a></p>, <p>WhatsApp made some major announcements in the year 2018. The company introduced an array of updates like delete button, group calls, PiP mode, Stickers and more. All of these features are important and interesting but there's more that can be done with the app.</p>, <p>For example wouldn't it be cool if WhatsApp had a feature that could inform you as soon as your best friend came online or a feature that could let others know that you are not in the mood to chat at the moment. It would be so much better then.</p>, <p>These and similar more features we have listed below that could make WhatsApp a much better app this year. Check it out:</p>, <p><strong>-- Ignore button: </strong>WhatsApp can add an ignore button that could let the other person know that he or she is being ignored. Blue ticks leave one hanging on to hope that he or she may get a reply not immediately but surely. Ignore button would end this wait by straight away letting the sender know that the recipient is not interested in his or her messages. Ouch!</p>, <p><strong>-- Auto sent messages on festivals:</strong> Another highly-desirable feature that we want on WhatsApp. Sending message to each and every family member on a festival can be a fight in itself. It would be great if WhatsApp comes up with a feature that automatically sends wishing messages to selected contacts on festivals.</p>, <p><strong>-- Like and dislike button for Status:</strong> Ever since WhatsApp brought this feature, people have cramped the given space with all kinds of photos and texts. Like and dislike button will help those who post in Status know if their posts are pleasing or annoying.</p>, <p><strong>-- Do not disturb: </strong>WhatsApp has a mute option that mutes the chat for a specific time period but it does not stop the messages from coming. The messages keep coming and show up as unread chats in your WhatsApp window. WhatsApp can have a DND mode for the app that informs all the contacts that you are unavailable for chatting and that they should not send you any messages during then.</p>, <p><strong>-- Schedule messages:</strong> Facebook has an option to schedule post so that it appears only when you want it to. A similar feature can be added to WhatsApp that allows you to schedule your messages.</p>, <p><strong>-- Profile picture viewers:</strong> WhatsApp profile pictures are no less than Facebook profile pictures. Everyone secretly wants his or her profile picture to be looked at and admired by others.

[<p class="">December 31, 2018</p>, <p></p>, <p>Black holes are thought to arise when very massive stars collapse, creating regions of space from which neither light nor any other form of matter can escape.

He was the seventh European astronaut to visit the ISS, and the first from the Netherlands.</p>, <p>Long-distance calls are available to crew members of the ISS.</p>, <p>In a <a href="https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/can-astronauts-phone-home-whenever-they-want/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2013 interview with Space Answers</a>, NASA Flight Director Holly Riddings said astronauts in the ISS use an IP phone, which works functionally through a computer. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like \u2018Space Skype\u2019. They can call any phone in the world if they have the right satellite coverage,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>It seems astronauts calling the wrong number could be a thing.

On the center console, look for a touchpad controller to further interact with MBUX, as well as various buttons for controlling other in-car functions.</p>, <p>Lights on with a simple hand move. The Interior Assistant in the new CLA.</p>, <p>The teaser video is actually meant to highlight Interior Assistant, a cabin feature introduced earlier in the new <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/news/2020-mercedes-benz-gle-class-msrp-pricing/">Mercedes GLE-Class crossover</a></span>.

[<p class=""></p>, <p class=""> In just a few decades, <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/technology">technology</a> has gone from Walkmans that play cassette tapes to <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/iphone">iPhones</a> that play music and videos, make calls, connect to the internet, take photos, and perform countless other tasks. </p>, <p class=""> The <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/25-everyday-things-made-obsolete-this-century-2016-6"> swift pace of progress</a> means that some gadgets get left behind. </p>, <p class=""> Here are 16 pieces of technology from the last 50 years that are no longer in use. </p>, <p class=""> This original portable music player was popular during the 1980s. The first model sold only 3,000 units in its first month of release in <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-first-sony-walkman-goes-on-sale"> 1979</a>. Clever marketing on the streets of Tokyo saved the personal cassette player, and sales soared the very next month. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/22/an-era-ends-sony-stops-manufacturing-cassette-walkmans/">Sony stopped producing new Walkmans in 2010</a> after a successful 30-year run. </p>, <p class=""> Emergency services still use pagers since they're more <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyw9zq/why-are-pagers-still-a-thing"> reliable than cell phones during natural disasters,</a> but they've otherwise vanished from popular use. </p>, <p class=""> The Motorola RAZR was released in 2004 and became the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ghosts-of-christmas-past-the-original-motorola-razr/"> best-selling flip phone of all time</a> with over 130 million sold over four years. The iPhone made it pretty obsolete \u2014 a 2008 report found that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/study-gives-insight-into-iphone-users/"> 23.8% of iPhone users</a> had switched over from the RAZR. </p>, <p class=""> The original <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/4033/Nintendo-Game-Boy/">Nintendo Game Boy was released in 1989</a>. The small monochrome screen and modest onboard power didn't stop this predecessor of the Nintendo 3Ds from <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/30/nintendos-game-boy-turns-25-a-look-back-at-the-bus.aspx">outselling</a> its better equipped competitors. The model was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/21/nintendo-game-boy-25-facts-for-its-25th-anniversary">discontinued</a> in the early 2000s. </p>, <p class=""> The <a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/design/you-have-died-of-dysentery-oregon-trail-design">1985 Apple II version of "The Oregon Trail"</a> is considered the original by many who have played it. But the true original version of the game was <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/523694/sally-died-dysentery-history-oregon-trail">released in 1971</a> for Teletype machines. Production of the popular video game ended years ago, but the gameplay lives on in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/oregon-trail-card-game-simple-repetitive-and-youll-die-of-dysentery-a-lot/">new tabletop card game</a> and online at the <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990">Internet Archive</a>. </p>, <p class=""> Panasonic produced the <a href="https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/history/chronicle/1998.html"> first portable DVD players</a> in 1998. Now most laptops <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/death-of-the-computer-optical-drive-832403"> don't even come with a CD drive</a>. </p>, <p class=""> The first commercial provider of dial-up internet access <a href="https://www.livescience.com/20727-internet-history.html">launched in 1989</a>. Children of the '90s will remember that characteristic beeping sound as the internet connection was made and tying up phone lines while browsing the web. </p>, <p class=""> A 2013 Pew Research Center study found that just <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/3-of-americans-use-dial-up-at-home/"> three percent of Americans still use dial-up at home</a>. </p>, <p class=""> American inventor Christopher Latham Sholes <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/typewriter">was inspired to build the first typewriter in 1867</a>, with the machine finally hitting the market in 1874. Though computers have overwhelmingly replaced this archaic form of producing typed content, typewriters still have their fans today, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvqa3y/people-are-still-using-typewriters-you-just-stopped-paying-attention-313"> among them, reportedly, Tom Hanks</a>. </p>, <p class=""> Palm Computing's first digital assistant, the Pilot 1000, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/167231/history_of_palm.html#slide2"> hit the market in 1996.</a> While PDAs were able to hold <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-buy-a-new-iphone-for-less-than-the-original-palmpilot/"> address books, appointments, and notes</a>, they were overtaken by iPhones and Androids, which featured far more advanced capabilities, within 20 years. </p>, <p class=""> The first digital camera was <a href="https://petapixel.com/2010/08/05/the-worlds-first-digital-camera-by-kodak-and-steve-sasson/"> created in 1975 by</a><a href="https://petapixel.com/2010/08/05/the-worlds-first-digital-camera-by-kodak-and-steve-sasson/"> Steve Sasson</a>. It weighed eight pounds and took 23 seconds to create a photo. </p>, <p class=""> As the technology improved and brought pocket-sized, battery-operated cameras to the scene, sales rose in the early 2000s. But as smartphone cameras became the norm, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-camera-shipments-15-years-decline-and-rise-2018-2"> sales steadily declined starting in 2011</a>, rising only slightly in 2017. </p>, <p class=""> AT&amp;T <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/22/business/la-fi-lazarus22-2009nov22">announced</a><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/22/business/la-fi-lazarus22-2009nov22"> that it was leaving the pay phone market</a> back in 2007, another public gadget made unnecessary thanks to cell phones. </p>, <p class=""> PC World <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2803487/PC-World-announces-the-end-of-the-floppy-disk.html"> announced that they would stop selling floppy disks</a> in 2007. External hard drives, thumb drives, or "the cloud" are now the way to go. </p>, <p class=""> 2016 was the first year that a majority of American homes did not have a landline, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201705.pdf">Center for Disease Control</a>, and more than 70% of all adults aged 25 to 34 were living in wireless-only households. Home phone numbers are on their way out. </p>, <p class=""> A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/19/what-teens-do-with-their-phones/"> 25% of teens don't ever talk on a cell phone</a>. These days, texting is easier and less awkward than recording a voicemail. Some smartphones even transcribe voicemail messages automatically, rendering answering machines a thing of the past. </p>, <p class=""> Kodachrome film was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kodak-stopped-making-film-nearly-190829563.html"> discontinued in 2010</a>, but Kodak recently announced it would start producing another kind of film that can be processed more quickly called Ektachrome. Thanks to digital smartphone cameras or DSLRs, people rarely have film developed these days. </p>, <p class=""> In 1987, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2016/07/23/rip-vhs-worlds-last-vcr-to-be-made-this-month/#70eb10a23da1"> 90% of the $5.25 billion VCR market in the US</a> was based on the VHS format, according to Forbes. DVD players <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3335984/DVD-kills-the-video-show-as-digital-age-takes-over.html"> first</a> outsold VCRs in 2002.

[<p>It\u2019s not easy to just cozy up to a rock barely longer than the Empire State Building.</p>, <p>Artist's concept of OSIRIS-REx entering orbit at asteroid Bennu.</p>, <p>Heather Roper/University of Arizona</p>, <p>While <a href="https://www.popsci.com/nasa-images-new-horizons-flyby-mu69">New Horizons soaked up most of the world\u2019s thirst for space stories</a> over the holiday, there was another success story worth unpacking: <a href="https://www.popsci.com/megapixels-nasa-asteroid-bennu">NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</a> finally <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/805/nasas-osiris-rex-spacecraft-enters-close-orbit-around-bennu-breaking-record/">entered asteroid Bennu\u2019s orbit</a>, after <a href="https://www.popsci.com/nasa-asteroid-mission-osiris-rex-launch">more than two years of hurtling through space</a> toward the rock. On the afternoon of December 31, about 70 million miles away from Earth, Bennu broke the record for becoming the smallest object in space to have a human-made spacecraft in its orbit.</p>, <p>This was not a routine operation for NASA. Trying to insert a spacecraft into the orbit of an object like Bennu is a fraught process. The team at NASA ended up having to account for a myriad of variables that could have derailed the entire thing.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/tags/osiris-rex">OSIRIS-REx</a> currently sits in an elliptical orbit about a mile from the center of Bennu, taking 61 hours to complete a full spin. Bennu itself has a diameter of about 0.3 miles, and a mass of about 78 billion kilograms. The bigger the mass, the bigger the gravity\u2014which allows for smaller objects to find their way into a stable orbit around larger objects. Unfortunately for Bennu, its small mass means it possesses 0.000005 times the gravity of Earth, which means it\u2019s relatively easy for any object to simply escape the gravitational field and just keep floating on by into space (or crash into Bennu itself if it\u2019s moving too fast). Yikes.</p>, <p>\u201c[Bennu] is nearing the smallest object that you could possibly get to achieve a stable orbit around a body,\u201d says Jason Leonard, the lead for the orbit determination team for the OSIRIS-REx mission. \u201c[Bennu\u2019s] size played the largest obstacle.\u201d But the asteroid\u2019s size is also why they chose it\u2014because some type of orbit was actually achievable. \u201cAnything else could have allowed the spacecraft to escape [orbit].\u201d</p>, <p>The small size and gravity can often become exacerbated when they interact with other forces at play. For example, the OSIRIS-REx team originally wanted to see if a circular orbit was possible, but as Leonard explains, the team soon realized that pressure created by sunlight combined with the tenuous gravity of Bennu could be enough to start pushing the spacecraft out, creating wobbles and strains in its orbit.</p>, <p>\u201cThere were early challenges, before we really knew what Bennu\u2019s shape was, what its mass was, and how it moved, that made for a lot of projected orbits that would wander back and forth,\u201d he says. The team actually didn\u2019t know what Bennu\u2019s mass or gravity field looked like until OSIRIS-REx finally arrived at the asteroid in early December. None of these unknowns created a grave concern that OSIRIS-REx would abruptly fall out of orbit or get slung out into space, but obviously, you can\u2019t really move forward with stable scientific work if you don\u2019t have a stable orbit.</p>, <p>The team\u2019s response was to ensure a \u201cfrozen orbit, which kind of takes other perturbing forces into account to help anchor the orbit [of OSIRIS-REx], so none of these other constraints impact it,\u201d says Leonard. Artificial satellites above the Earth often have frozen orbits to minimize the impact of solar pressure, gravity, and spacecraft movement on orbital drift.</p>, <p>Moving forward, the orbit determination team is keeping a keen eye on any influences caused by gravitational forces, mass redistribution on the asteroid, thermal pressures, thruster firings, solar pressure, and other physical factors that could affect how the spacecraft moves around the asteroid. In June, the team will move OSIRIS-REx into a nearer orbit, closer to half-a-mile from the surface.</p>, <p>If something unexpected does happen\u2014which would more likely be an unforeseen problem with the spacecraft\u2019s hardware or software, or an anomaly picked up by the onboard sensors\u2014the team has a built-in safety maneuver to have OSIRIS-REx escape Bennu\u2019s orbit and head toward the sun until the problem can be resolved.</p>, <p>\u201cEverything has gone incredibly well to date,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cComing in, we had a lot of contingency plans. We were planning for every single possible thing we could think of. None of that came to fruition.\u201d The mass of Bennu was less than predicted, but that had a minimal effect on the orbital insertion plan. \u201cThe spacecraft is performing much better than we ever anticipated.\u201d</p>, <p>Many of the techniques designed to pull off an orbital insertion on a small object like Bennu have only arisen in the last decade or so. Some are actually refined based on experience others have had with missions like the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/rosettas-best-moments">European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta</a>, or <a href="https://www.popsci.com/Hayabusa-mascot-asteroid-rover">Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s Hayabusa 1 and 2</a>. Probably the biggest lessons were taken from NASA\u2019s Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous-Shoemaker mission from the late \u201890s and early \u201800s, which studied the near-Earth asteroid Eros.</p>, <p>The key difference is that those missions \u201cjust didn\u2019t require the precision required to get down to the surface of this small-sized asteroid,\u201d says Leonard. After all, one of the most crucial pieces of the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/what-will-happen-to-osiris-rexs-asteroid-sample">OSIRIS-REx mission is to collect an asteroid sample</a> that can go back to Earth for laboratory study.</p>, <p>There\u2019s a lot in store for OSIRIS-REx and Bennu, and the excitement is only set to build as thing unfold. \u201cThe last few months since Bennu first showed up in our cameras as a dot or speck of light, to now as a whole world teaming with boulders and features, have really brought out the enthusiasm of the team,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cWe are at the crossroads of engineering and science in deep space exploration.\u201d</p>, <p>Sign up to receive our weekly email newsletter and never miss an update!</p>, <p class="legal-text">By submitting above, you agree to <br/><a href="/privacy-policy">our privacy policy</a>.</p>, <p>You can appeal when your social media content gets taken down, but you need to know where to look.</p>, <p>It\u2019s not easy to just cozy up to a rock barely longer than the Empire State Building.</p>, <p>This robot cleaner can follow a 'smart map' of your place.</p>, <p>A Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 10 hours of instruction for $139.99.</p>, <p>A balanced diet is best, but these additions could help.</p>, <p>The secret to a healthier diet is simpler than you might think.</p>, <p>It's the first time a working rover has touched down on the far side.</p>, <p>New high-res images from New Horizons reveal a very blobby space rock.</p>, <p>Sign up to receive our email newsletter and never miss an update!</p>, <p class="legal-text">By submitting above, you agree to <a href="/privacy-policy">our privacy policy</a>.</p>, <p>Many products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) rely on the thin hull of the station to protect them from the vacuum of space. Even a small breach could spell disaster for the station and its crew, so personnel on the ground carefully monitor conditions. It\u2019s a good thing, too. The crew was alerted to a drop in pressure in September last year, leading to the discovery of a small hole in a Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the station. This has been the subject of much speculation, but former ISS commander Alexander Gerst now says he believes the hole was caused by a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/01/01/leak-international-space-station-blamed-botched-repair-job/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">botched repair job</a>. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subsequent investigation of the Soyuz damage has been a roller coaster ride showcasing the declining relations between the US and Russia. Initially, NASA believed the hole was the result of a micrometeoroid impact. However, closer inspection showed several gouges and scratches that could have been made by a drill.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the damage was inside the Russian spacecraft, Roscosmos was tasked with the investigation. Russian news sources and officials have repeatedly speculated that the hole was the result of <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/276551-russian-investigators-suggest-iss-damage-could-have-been-sabotage">deliberate sabotage</a>, even going so far as to cast aspersions on the crew of the ISS. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soyuz capsule in question flew to the ISS in June 2018 carrying three passengers: Russia\u2019s Sergey Prokopyev, Germany\u2019s Alexander Gerst, and Serena Au\xf1\xf3n-Chancellor of the US. Gerst returned to Earth last month, and he recently sat down for an interview with BBC Radio 4. When asked about the hole, he had a much less sensational take. He believes someone on the ground damaged the spacecraft and improperly repaired it.</span></p>, <p><a href="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-283050" height="360" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-640x360.jpg" srcset="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-223x126.jpg 223w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-106x59.jpg 106w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179-348x196.jpg 348w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iss057e106179.jpg 737w" width="640"/></a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gerst, the hole was most likely caused by a drill, and not the kind of drill astronauts have aboard the ISS. The 2-millimeter hole in the capsule caused a drop in station pressure, but it was never life-threatening to the crew. The hole had a small spot of glue over the top, indicating someone tried to repair the damage, Gerst said. If the patch had failed while the capsule was heading to the ISS, the crew could have been in greater danger due to the smaller volume of the Soyuz compared with the whole ISS. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question remains: who made the hole? There\u2019s at least one similar instance of drill damage to a Soyuz capsule. In that case, a worker on the ground damaged the spacecraft and attempted to cover up the mistake with an epoxy patch. The damage was detected pre-launch, though. Odds are something similar happened this time, but no one noticed the damage in time. It\u2019s not as sexy as an <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/276998-russian-media-spreading-absurd-conspiracy-theory-regarding-iss-damage">outer space conspiracy</a>, but few things are.</span></p>, <p>Now read:</p>, <p>Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.</p>, <p>\r\n            \xa9 1996-2019            <a href="http://www.ziffdavis.com/" target="_blank">Ziff Davis, LLC.

[<p class=""></p>, <p class=""> The break is over, and we're heading full speed into a new year that's jam-packed with major video games. </p>, <p class=""> In January alone, two massive games are scheduled to arrive: "Kingdom Hearts 3" and "Resident Evil 2." The former is a highly-anticipated sequel starring a massive list of Disney all-stars, and the latter is a highly-anticipated remake of a beloved gaming classic. </p>, <p class=""> And that's before we start talking about risky new blockbusters like "Anthem," from the folks behind "Mass Effect," and the first-ever "Mario Kart" game for smartphones! </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Here's what to expect from the world of video games across the next three months:</strong></p>, <p class=""> The long-awaited remake of fan-favorite horror classic "Resident Evil 2" is nearly ready \u2014 it's set to arrive early in 2019, just like so many other great games currently in development. </p>, <p class=""> "Resident Evil 2" introduced the world to Leon S. Kennedy (seen above) \u2014 the main character in "Resident Evil 4." Kennedy and Claire Redfield find themselves in the middle of a surprise zombie outbreak in the fictional town of Raccoon City. It's an action-packed introduction to many of the major themes of the "Resident Evil" franchise, and it's getting gorgeously remade for modern consoles. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> January 25, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the "Toy Story" gang are moving from film to video games with "Kingdom Hearts 3," an upcoming Xbox One and PlayStation 4 action-adventure game. </p>, <p class=""> The game is the long-anticipated third entry in the "Kingdom Hearts" series \u2014 the last major entry, "Kingdom Hearts 2," launched all the way back in 2005 on the PlayStation 2. In "Kingdom Hearts," various Disney characters and their worlds are mashed up with characters that would be right at home in a "Final Fantasy" game. </p>, <p class=""> Alongside the cast of "Toy Story" (and their Earth-like setting), "Kingdom Hearts 3" also stars Goofy and Donald Duck. You may have noticed a third character here \u2014 that's "Sora," the main character of "Kingdom Hearts 3" and the one you'll play as. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> January 29, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One </p>, <p class=""> A new "Far Cry" game? Didn't one of those come out, like, in 2018? </p>, <p class=""> Yep! That game was "Far Cry 5," and it came out back in late March on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The open-world first-person shooter was set in America for the first time ever, and featured a new antagonist: a maniacal cult leader with nuclear ambitions. </p>, <p class=""> "Far Cry New Dawn" is a sequel to that game, set in a post-apocalypse Montana 17 years after the events of "Far Cry 5." The trailer alludes to a period of extreme weather following a nuclear detonation, eventually leading to a new world \u2014 a world where people shoot saw blades from crossbows, apparently. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 15, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> The fighting game renaissance is in full swing, and "Dead or Alive" is the next major fighting series to get a new entry in 2019. "Dead or Alive 6" continues in the tradition of the dozens of "Dead or Alive" games before it, featuring 3D fighting focused on counters and parries. </p>, <p class=""> If history is any indication, "Dead or Alive 6" will also feature stages with multiple areas and interactive elements. We'll see soon enough, as the game is due out in just a couple months. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 15, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> "Crackdown 3" has been in the works for years at this point, having been delayed multiple times. </p>, <p class=""> As the name implies, it's the third game in the open-world, third-person action "Crackdown" series. But this time, apparently, it stars Terry Crews. </p>, <p class=""> The series is big on mobility \u2014 allowing you to go anywhere you want \u2014 and huge explosions. It looks like the third game in the series is no different in this respect. </p>, <p class=""> Since "Crackdown 3" is published by Microsoft, expect it to arrive on the Xbox Game Pass service at launch \u2014 instead of buying the game for $60, you could always play it through Game Pass for far less. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 15, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PC </p>, <p class=""> Remember "Mass Effect"? How about "Dragon Age," or "The Knights of the Old Republic"? </p>, <p class=""> That trio of blockbusters came from the folks at EA's BioWare studios \u2014 the same people behind next year's "Anthem," an all-new action-RPG. Like "Destiny," BioWare's "Anthem" is played online and focuses on players grouping up to collectively take on missions. </p>, <p class=""> Frankly speaking, what we've seen so far looks gorgeous and thrilling. Each player has the ability to fly through the air, Iron Man-style, whenever they want. It adds a layer of exploration that makes it unlike anything else available. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 22, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> Like so many other video games, the "Metro" series is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Unlike many of those games, "Metro" is set in Russia. It envisions a post-apocalypse shaped by nuclear radiation, dwindling resources, and unpredictable, extreme weather conditions. </p>, <p class=""> It's a game about nuclear monsters, survival, and humanity. It's also a first-person shooter, so expect lots of shooting. </p>, <p class=""> In "Metro: Exodus," the series finally exits the underground subway tunnels of previous games for higher ground. What you'll find there remains to be seen, but we're betting it's gruesome. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 22, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> The "Trials" series is years-deep at this point, and it's still a surprising delight. The game is pretty straightforward: carefully pilot a dirt bike through precarious stages that are rife with traps and pitfalls. </p>, <p class=""> If you've spent any time watching bicycle or motorbike-based trials, you're no doubt familiar with what this game series is all about: Precision movement in extremely dangerous settings. "Trials" takes that formula and turns it into a risk-free video game, and then it adds massive, ridiculous explosions. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> February 26, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, Nintendo Switch </p>, <p class=""> Early 2019 is going to be rife with slick-looking third-person action games, and "Devil May Cry 5" is the perfect example. </p>, <p class=""> The series is known for its ultra-stylish characters, deep fighting system, and over-the-top settings. If the first trailer for the game is any indication, "Devil May Cry 5" takes those ideas and runs with them (then leaps into the air and murders, like, two dozen flying demons). </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> March 8, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> New York City? That's old hat \u2014 in "The Division 2," you're headed straight into the nation's capital to straighten out some bad guys from a third-person perspective. </p>, <p class=""> As in the first "Division" game, players group up online to tackle missions. It's reminiscent of games like "Destiny" and the upcoming "Anthem" \u2014 a third-person shooter with a focus on cooperative play online. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> March 15, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> The folks behind the "Souls" series ("Demons Souls" and "Dark Souls") and 2014's incredible "Bloodborne" are back at it \u2014 only this time, instead of a Cthulhu-inspired Victorian setting, the new game takes place in Feudal Japan. </p>, <p class=""> In "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice," you play as a ninja out for justice. Like previous third-person action games from the folks at From Software, "Sekiro" promises to be extremely difficult. Any enemy can take you down, and your best bet is to carefully, tactically, take down each foe. Unlike previous From Software games, "Sekiro" features a major stealth component, as well as a ton of mobility (as seen above). </p>, <p class=""> Frankly speaking, it looks <em class="">rad</em>. </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Release Date:</strong> March 22, 2019 </p>, <p class=""><strong class="">Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC </p>, <p class=""> "Mario Kart" has been a big deal for more than 25 years. And now \u2014 <em class="">finally</em>\u2014 it's coming to smartphones as "Mario Kart Tour." </p>, <p class=""> The game is scheduled to arrive before March 2019, when Nintendo's fiscal year ends, and thus far we have no indication that it will miss that deadline. </p>, <p class=""> So, what is "Mario Kart Tour"? </p>, <p class=""> That's the big question. Nintendo hasn't spoken of the game in nearly a year. But there's one game already available that offers a peek into what Nintendo may be doing with "Mario Kart Tour": "Super Mario Run." </p>, <p class=""> It seems entirely likely that "Mario Kart Tour" will offer a few levels for free, then charge a lump sum for access to the full game (like "Super Mario Run" did). Both "Super Mario" and "Mario Kart" are core Nintendo franchises. "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" is the second-highest selling Switch game to date, behind only "Super Mario Odyssey." </p>, <p class=""> Simply put: "Mario Kart Tour" is the kind of game for which Nintendo can demand a premium, and it likely will. </p>, <p class=""> Get the latest Microsoft stock price <a href="http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/MSFT-Quote">here.</a></p>, <p class=""> Get the latest Google stock price <a href="http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/GOOG-Quote">here.</a></p>]

[<p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/09/xiaomi-poco-f1-review-the-best-value-android-smartphone-available.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocophone F1</a> aka Poco F1 has managed to become quite a popular device in 2018, and even though we didn\u2019t really see any legit info regarding its successor, Ben Geskin has just <a href="https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/1080631330034147328" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> a concept render of the device. <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/xiaomi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xiaomi</a> is the company behind the Pocophone F1, and if this concept render ends up being close to the real design of the Pocophone F2, then you can expect a rather different approach by the company. The Pocophone F1 sported a really hard-to-miss notch, while the phone shown today comes with a tiny, waterdrop notch which houses the phone\u2019s front-facing camera, while an earpiece is placed right above it. The chin on this phone is also noticeably thinner than the one on the Pocophone F1, and the phone\u2019s display sports rounded corners. The volume up, down, and power / lock buttons are all located on the right-hand side of the phone, while the phone\u2019s SIM card tray is probably accessible from the left. A regular fingerprint scanner is shown on the back of the phone, while you will notice that there are two vertically-aligned cameras included in the top-left corner of the phone\u2019s back. A dual-LED flash is located below those two cameras, while the \u201cPoco\u201d branding is visible on the back of the phone as well. Based on the provided image, it is not exactly clear as to what materials were envisioned for this phone, but it seems like that\u2019s not glass on the back.</p>, <p><strong>Pocophone F1 vs Pocophone F2 Concept</strong></p>, <p>The Pocophone F1 did sport two cameras on the back, just like this concept Pocophone F2 smartphone, though the Pocophone F1\u2019s cameras were centered, while a fingerprint scanner was placed right below them. The curved on the back of the Pocophone F1 is also more pronounced than on this concept render, while the bezels are thinner on the Pocophone F2 render, definitely. Another obvious difference can be seen in the notch department, as the Pocophone F1\u2019s notch is quite wide, and unsightly, while the Pocophone F2 concept render comes with an Essential PH-1-like notch, which is much easier to ignore, at least for some people. This concept render really does not have to represent the upcoming Pocophone F2 smartphone, but it may, who knows, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what is Xiaomi preparing for us.</p>, <p><strong>Pocophone F2 Arrival And What To Expect</strong></p>, <p>The Pocophone F1 managed to become so popular mainly because of its low price tag and powerful specifications. Some people consider the Pocophone F1 to be the new OnePlus One, as it not only shipped with the Snapdragon 845, 6GB / 8GB of RAM, and a large battery, but it offered a much lower price tag than the OnePlus 6 and 6T, for example. The Pocophone F1 is in a league of its own when it comes to pricing and specs ratio, and consumers will expect the same to be the case with the Pocophone F2, that\u2019s for sure. Not a single detail regarding the Pocophone F2 surfaced thus far, but it\u2019s safe to assume that it will be fueled by the Snapdragon 855 once it becomes official. The Pocophone F2 launch is quite probably far away at this point, as the Pocophone F1 arrived back in August last year, so the Pocophone F2 will probably launch in Q3 2019. The Pocophone F2 will probably include at least 6GB of RAM, while you can expect a large display to be included in the package, a display larger than 6 inches. A large battery will be a part of the offering as well, while Android 9 Pie will come pre-installed on the device, along with Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI skin with POCO customizations. The device is expected to sport two cameras on the back, and it will be interesting to see whether Poco will opt for a plastic build once again, or will it opt for metal and glass instead, which would increase the price of the phone a bit, that\u2019s for sure. The Pocophone F2 probably won\u2019t support 5G, as that would increase its price considerably, but it will include two SIM card slots, just like its predecessor, that is a given. The Pocophone F1 includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it will be interesting to see whether Poco will do the same with the Pocophone F2, or will it follow the trend of removing audio jacks from phones.</p>]

[<p class="bodytext">A recent leak <a class="internal-link" href="New-device-with-395-000-Antutu-score-is-alleged-to-be-the-Sony-Xperia-XZ4.390691.0.html" target="_self">asserts</a> that a Sony device with the model number I8134 scored just over 395,000 in Antutu Benchmark scores. Now, a new one <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/01/03/sony-xperia-xz4-visits-geekbench-with-sd-855-8gb-ram-and-android-pie/" target="_blank">alleges</a> that the same device has gone to Geekbench 4, and scored impressively well there. On the other hand, as with the Antutu-related image, the listing as portrayed in this post is nowhere to be found on the benchmark's official website.\r</p>, <p class="bodytext">According to the latest Xperia-related <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/01/03/sony-xperia-xz4-visits-geekbench-with-sd-855-8gb-ram-and-android-pie/" target="_blank">rumor</a>, the 'r1_I8134' scored 3497 in the single-core tests in question, and 12801 in the multi-core ones. It apparently achieved these results on January 2. They are particularly impressive, as a Sony Xperia XZ3 <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/11496818" target="_blank">scored</a> only 2392 and 8862 in the single- and multi-core tests respectively a day later. The former device was also listed as running Android 9.0 (Pie) and as having 8GB of RAM.\r</p>, <p class="bodytext">The purported XZ4 was <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/01/03/sony-xperia-xz4-visits-geekbench-with-sd-855-8gb-ram-and-android-pie/" target="_blank">apparently</a> powered by a Snapdragon processor with 8 cores and a base clock of 1.78GHz. This is not a million miles away from those of the<a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/11496818" target="_blank"> Snapdragon 845</a>; therefore, the chipset could be its successor, the 855, which <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-855-mobile-platform" target="_blank">is known</a> to be an octa-core CPU that can run up to 2.84GHz.

[<p><strong>During Overwatch Season 13, top Zarya players averaged almost 3,000 more damage per match than DPS heroes, like Soldier and Ashe did.</strong></p>, <p style="font-size:12px;color:#ccc;">Advertisement</p>, <p>DPS heroes are typically expected to have the most damage output during\xa0an Overwatch match, but it looks like the GOATs meta, which basically consists of three tanks and three healers, is giving Zarya a chance to shine.</p>, <p>GOATs became popular after an Open Division team of the same name went undefeated using the strategy for the first time. Since then, it has replaced Dive as the go-to team comp for most professional teams.</p>, <p>According to user Chief-TR on /r/Competitive Overwatch, using data taken from Overbuff, the top 10 Zarya players averaged 23,042 damage per match during Season 13.</p>, <p>This is almost 3,000 more damage per match than the top Ashe players, who averaged 20,790, or elite Hanzo mains, who averaged 20,435 damage per match.</p>, <p>Because of the way GOATs is played, Chief-TR and other users came to the conclusion that it is the prevalence of GOATs that allows Zarya to deal so much damage.</p>, <p>Some users said in the comments that it wasn\u2019t actually GOATs, but the change to close-range brawl team compositions once Brigitte was introduced into the game, that allows Zarya to gain charge and deal more damage than anyone else.</p>, <p>Since this data is only from the top 10 players for each hero, Zarya might not actually be the highest damage dealer in say, gold or platinum ranks, but when it comes to top 500, she definitely is.</p>, <p>Even though it\u2019s a small sample size, these numbers do a good job of showing the niche that Zarya has against high damage-dealing compositions, like GOATs.</p>, <p class="flex-auto ml2 my0">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe use cookies on this website to improve your experience.

Therefore, GPUs are more cost-effective for crypto mining, but CPUs have a broader consumer base.\xa0</span><span></span><!-- sh_cad_6 --></p>, <p><span>According to Rolland, the crypto boom in 2017 led both Nvidia and AMD to overproduce GPUs for crypto mining, causing an inventory problem when digital currencies <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/crypto-is-crashing-hard-as-bitcoin-falls-below-6000/articleshow/65398770.cms" target="_blank">crashed in 2018</a>. </span><!-- sh_cad_7 --></p>, <p><span>For AMD, thanks to its CPU business, the market has a lot more hope and optimism.\xa0</span><span>"The prospects for their CPU business versus Intel are the best that have been in decades," he said.\xa0</span><!-- sh_cad_8 --></p>, <p><span>Last year, AMD shares surged by more than 230% through the middle of September as rival <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/intc-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel</a> was contending with a production <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amd-stock-price-steal-market-share-intel-chip-problems-says-2018-9-1027555704?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank">delay for its 10-nanometer chips</a>.

But the engineers at BMW apparently want to build something even more extreme. According to a new report from <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-plots-supercar-take-mclaren" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autocar</a>, BMW plans to develop a new hybrid, mid-engined supercar that would compete with entries from the likes of McLaren.</p>, <p class="speakableTextP2">Autocar says that rather than a direct <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/roadshow/reviews/2017-bmw-i8-review/">BMW i8</a></span> successor, the new model would be much more expensive and considerably more powerful. It would reportedly use a six-cylinder engine, instead of the i8's turbocharged triple, and gutsier electric motors. All told, 700 horsepower is allegedly the target. As with the i8 -- and the supercars BMW aims to compete with -- the new model would be built from carbon fiber to keep weight low.</p>, <p>"If you are an engineer, once in your life, you want to make a super-sports car," Klaus Fr\xf6hlich, BMW's board member responsible for research and development, told Autocar. "I think partial electrification will enable that."</p>, <p>BMW has publicly committed to launching <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/news/bmw-readying-four-door-electric-i-concept-car-for-frankfurt-motor-show/">at least 25 electrified vehicles by 2025</a></span>, of which 13 will be fully electric. Rival supercar manufacturers are also pursing hybrid tech to improve both power and efficiency. McLaren, for instance, has said publicly that 50 percent of its lineup will be <a data-annotation="true" data-component="linkTracker" data-link-tracker-options='{"action":"inline-annotation|Hybrids|CNET_CAT_TOPIC|298"}' href="/roadshow/hybrids/">hybrids</a> by 2022 and <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/news/mclaren-track25-new-cars-all-hybrids/">100 percent will be hybrids by 2025</a></span>.

It also means that problems such as cracked screens may not be as big of an issue as they are at present.</p>, <p>Google says the sensor can allow users to press an invisible 'button' between the thumb and index fingers or a virtual dial that turns by rubbing a thumb against the index finger.</p>, <p>It means that we may soon control gadgets such as phones and smartwatches by gesturing rather than tapping the screen.</p>, <p>The company, which recently started selling smartphones and other devices directly in Ireland, has been trying to win approval for the technology for three years.

It provides details of consumers on a merchant\u2019s remarketing list. \u201cIn-market\u201d describes the broad industries those consumers are interested in based on their search history and other online activity. \u201cAffinity\u201d describes, roughly, the consumers\u2019 association with the in-market industry.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">This sample Audience Insights report provides details of consumers on a merchant\u2019s remarketing list. <em>Source: Search Engine Land.</em></p>, <p>From this high-level view, we can conclude that many of the consumers on the above remarketing list are interested in \u201cChristmas Items &amp; Decor.\u201d They are \u201cHome Decor Enthusiasts\u201d and \u201cDo-It-Yourselfers.\u201d If this were your report, and you sell holiday decorating items, you could create content on ideas for using your products via blog posts, videos, and product descriptions. All could appear in organic search results and appeal to relevant shoppers.</p>, <p>Audience Insights can also show how much more frequently your users convert by category or product when compared to the typical website user. In the example below, looking in the \u201cIndex\u201d column, note that people in the \u201cCarpet Installation\u201d audience convert 15.5 times more frequently than the average searcher.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">The \u201cCarpet Installation\u201d audience convert 15.5 times more frequently than the average searcher, as noted in the \u201cIndex\u201d column. <em>Click image to enlarge.\xa0</em></p>, <p>For a business that converts a large percentage of consumers searching for carpeting, it makes sense to <a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/the-key-requirement-of-content-marketing">spend money on content</a>, such as the benefits of buying installed carpeting rather than area rugs. It could pepper more carpet-related content into guides, blog posts,\xa0and social content.</p>, <p>However, for the same business, allocating budget to, say, a blog post about \u201cDesign Software\u201d (with a 7.6 conversion multiple) may help users, but it won\u2019t win nearly the same carpeting sales.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leveraging Google Ads\u2019 data for SEO campaigns can be very helpful in my experience. Unfortunately, it\u2019s common for SEO and PPC teams to work independently. I see it all the time; teams do not share data \u2014 in-house and at external agencies. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google has greatly reduced access to organic search data. But it\u2019s readily available to those who pay for Google Ads. While the Performance tab in the new <a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/search-console-is-the-gateway-to-google-seo-data">Google Search Console</a> contains some of this organic data, it\u2019s not to the level of Google Ads.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the silo exists in your company, fix it. If you work with an agency that does not share its data, have a serious conversation. SEO practitioners need to know what their potential audience wants. Every query entered into a search engine is a need. Understanding those needs helps to create relevant content. It\u2019s that simple.</span></p>, <p>I\u2019ve heard people say that SEO produces free traffic. True, you don\u2019t pay directly for the traffic, but it\u2019s not free. You still need to invest time and money. What better way than <a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/7-ways-integrate-natural-paid-search">through Google Ads</a>?</p>, <p>When you\u2019re using the \u201ctargeting\u201d setting (such as affinity audiences, placements, or remarketing) for your campaigns or ad groups, you\u2019re telling Google Ads who you\u2019d like to reach with your ads or where you\u2019d like your ads to show across the internet. Use that setting in your ad groups or campaigns to show to specific audiences or on specific content. Experiment and learn even more about your audience.</p>, <p>Here are a few ways to continue the discovery.</p>, <p>\n                        Copyright \xa9 2005 - 2019.<br/>\n                        Practical Ecommerce\xae is a <br/>\n                        registered trademark of  <br/>\n                        Confluence Distribution, Inc.  <br/></p>]

The option was labeled "UI Layout for the browser's top chrome;" switching from "Default" to "Normal" and restarting the browser restored the older UI.</p>, <p>But with Chrome 71, which Google started distributing Dec. 4, the "Normal" setting vanished.</p>, <p>That set off some users, who had been so unhappy with the even more minimalist UI, particularly the rectangular tabs and the lack of clear definition between tabs, that they'd reverted to a pre-69 design.</p>, <p>Chrome tabs in version 71.</p>, <p>"The new (tab) shape causes problems - you can't visually feel them, and the tab text gets crushed out. It's really inferior to the old shape and contrast," wrote <i>bhowes</i> in a <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/Fs2z642aopE;context-place=topicsearchin/chrome/ui" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> posted to the Chrome support forum.</p>, <p>Others chimed in. "Bring back the old GUI (graphical user interface) or I am switching," threatened <a href="https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/chrome/Fs2z642aopE/mhVM\\_1xrEAAJ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><i>XeX Menu togo</i>.</a></p>, <p>"Your browser is so ugly now that it's actually unusable, and customers are leaving because of it," contended <a href="https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/chrome/Fs2z642aopE/p3R\\_YttuEAAJ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><i>Ec Little</i></a>. "Whoever is responsible for this should be fired for causing Chrome to hemorrhage customers."</p>, <p>As <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chromes-new-ui-is-ugly-and-people-are-very-angry/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ZDNet</a> reported a week ago, examples of similar grievances were rampant across Twitter and on Reddit. One of a slew of reddit threads spelled out a gripe in stereotypical Reddit rage. "I'm off to Firefox until Google fixes the tabs o7 I'd rather not get blinded AND vomit every time I use Chrome," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/a7fbdt/im\\_off\\_to\\_firefox\\_until\\_google\\_fixes\\_the\\_tabs\\_o7/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><i>ferengi4</i></a>.</p>, <p>Others just mocked the browser. "Big Brother's removed the ability to change Chrome's UI," tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/Pancakeoflust/status/1080527051818332160" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Schulze</a> on Wednesday. "All must embrace Fisher-Price. Press the Horse icon for any questions or complaints."</p>, <p>Here and there, some refused to bend a knee to the UI mandate and pointed others toward <a href="https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/chrome/Fs2z642aopE/\\_OvJJaYbDwAJ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pre-71 copies of Chrome</a> that allowed interface roll-back.</p>, <p>A Google engineer said that would be wrong. "Please don't do this," pleaded Peter Kasting on Reddit. "As a Chrome dev, we would really rather you use another browser than try to lock yourself on an old version of Chrome. There are serious consequences to this, and much like choosing not to be vaccinated, the choice affects other people besides just you."</p>, <p>Kasting was referring to running an out-of-date version of Chrome, one that would no longer receive security updates.</p>, <p>He also downplayed Reddit-based criticism and argued that leaving a reversion option was bad practice. "Reddit posts are not an unbiased, representative sample of all feedback," he wrote. "I invite you to consider the arguments at <a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/07/options.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">(here)</a> for why teams don't necessarily choose to expose options." The link led to a post by Chrome developer Evan Martin, who argued that options were bad user experience and sometimes more trouble to maintain than a standard feature.</p>, <p>Kasting is no stranger to Chrome UI controversy. Nearly five years ago, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/lawrence-page-replace-peter-kasting-and-the-google-chrome-ui-team" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">petition</a> on <i>Change.org</i> demanded that Google executives fire Kasting and his UI team. "We have been betrayed by the Chrome team, having taken matters into their own hands and blatantly changing Chrome for what many see as far worse, far slower, and far less useful, but also more importantly taking away 'choice,'" said James Brown, who launched the petition.</p>, <p>Brown - and the 300 and some others who signed the online petition - were <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2487910/internet/google-yanks-option-to-restore-chrome-s-old-style-new-tab-page--riles-users-all-over-again.html">upset about changes to Chrome's new tab page</a>.

Some of the messages left by users were definitely <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/THPuNSLtljg/1EovqphG1bsJ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not workplace appropriate</a> while others were creative, if leaning toward the blasphemous. "For the love of the little crying infant baby Jesus would you STOP messing with my new tab page?" asked Steve Pittman in February 2014.</p>, <p>Other crusades of UI-change complaints launched against Chrome struck out at <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2487799/desktop-apps/windows-users-denounce-chrome-scrollbar-changes-that-mimic-chrome-os.html">revisions to the browser's scrollbar</a> (January 2014) and an <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2913426/web-browsers/chrome-users-roast-google-on-spit-of-hate-over-revamped-bookmarks-manager.html">overhaul of its bookmark manager</a> (April 2015).</p>, <p>"HATE - HATE - HATE the new format.

[<p id="Ft4oAf">Thanks to a few teasers, we know that our next <em>League of Legends </em>champion will be a chain wielder. The original image was shown in <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/08/champion-roadmap-august-2018/">a champion roadmap</a>, along with a teaser for Neeko. Other than the fact that this person has two legs and a set of chains, our next champion has been an absolute mystery. The newest set of teaser images bring a little more clarity to the issue, although its not a full reveal yet:</p>, <p id="GijwuT">These images, entitled Visions of Demacia, suggest that this chain champion has the ability to lock down and possibly even control enemies to some degree. Lux, Galio, Garen and Jarvan IV all have their abilities or weapons on display, and those chains are clearly locking three of the above champions up to some degree.</p>, <p id="q8xden">This could be a Demacian champion who shows the nation\u2019s darker side, which has so far only been hinted at.

There is a launcher that goes from Earth to low earth orbit or the launcher goes directly to higher orbits with lower mass. The SpaceX Super Heavy Starship should be flying to orbit by 2020 with a fully reusable rocket.

This was to allow many loads of fuel to be brought from Earth so that a fully fueled mission could be sent to Mars.</p>, <p>This also means that SpaceX Super Heavy Starships could be placed into Low Earth Orbit, High Earth Orbit, at Lagrange points, Cycler Orbits, and on the moon. They could be transferring fuel between vehicles and store fuel for other missions. Having vehicles and vehicles acting as refueling stations will greatly reduce the cost of moving around from space and not just to low earth orbit.</p>, <p>Going from low earth orbit to the surface of the moon takes about half of the fuel going from Earth to low earth orbit.</p>, <p>There could be SpaceX Super Heavy Starships placed into Lunar Cycling and Mars Cycling orbits.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153112" height="838" src="https://mk0nextbigfuturj5ioe.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fuelspacex.jpg" width="1440"/></p>, <p>Simplifying to have modifications of one vehicle for all of the roles in Space would reduce the development costs.

Other than the announcement that it\u2019s shutting down, the most recent post was 17 days ago.</p>, <p>This marks yet another failed attempt by Google at trying to create some type of social network.</p>, <p>Perhaps the most notable failure is Google+, which is scheduled to be shut down in the next few months.</p>, <p>There likely wasn\u2019t a need for a Small Business Community from Google, as business owners can already connect on more established platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>, <p>Get our daily newsletter from SEJ's Founder Loren Baker about the latest news in the industry!</p>, <p>Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

[<p>Back in April, I quit as a longtime AT&amp;T wireless customer and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/I-switched-from-AT-T-to-T-Mobile-Here-s-why-and-12878340.php">made the leap to using T-Mobile for my family\u2019s cellular provider</a>. I was lured by a much smaller price tag, much faster data speeds and a much-improved service footprint for the nation\u2019s third-largest carrier.</p>, <p>Eight months later, it\u2019s time for an update. In fact, I\u2019ve had quite a few emailed and social-media requests for a report on how it\u2019s working out. So, here\u2019s a scorecard:</p>, <p><strong>PRICING</strong>: <strong>A</strong></p>, <p>My main reason for ending a 20-year relationship with AT&amp;T was price. I was paying $175 a month for two phone lines; data access for two Apple Watches; and an allowance of 16 gigabytes of data. T-Mobile offers those 55 and older a great deal: two lines with unlimited data, text and voice for $70 a month. The Apple Watches added $10 each to make the final price $90, saving us $85 a month over AT&amp;T.</p>, <p><strong>NOT-SO-HAPPY CAMPER:\xa0<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/Switching-to-T-Mobile-with-a-side-of-Apple-13174768.php">Switching to <span class="gsa-hit-highlight">T</span>-<span class="gsa-hit-highlight">Mobile</span>, with a side of Apple: Confusion, exhaustion, frustration</a></strong></p>, <p><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/Switching-to-T-Mobile-with-a-side-of-Apple-13174768.php"></a>Near the end of December, T-Mobile was offering a promotion that allowed us to add our daughter to our 55+ plan for just $20 a month, bringing our total payment to $110 a month. She had been on an AT&amp;T prepay plan for $25 a month, but with no data. I was told by a T-Mobile rep via chat that this is not a promotional price that will go up. We\u2019ll see. (The extra-line promotion, by the way, is no longer available.)</p>, <p>Also, note that these prices include a discount if you use AutoPay. If you choose not to use it, each line costs an additional $5. Without AutoPay, we\u2019d pay another $25 monthly.</p>, <p><strong>DATA SPEED: A-</strong></p>, <p>T-Mobile consistently outperforms the speeds I was seeing with AT&amp;T in the places where I live, work and play. On speed tests taken periodically at my various stomping grounds, I\u2019ll get anywhere between 40-95 Mbps downloads when I\u2019ve got a full four bars. There are some exceptions, however.</p>, <p><strong>ZOOM:\xa0<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/How-fast-is-cellular-data-service-in-Texas-13086818.php">How fast is cellular data service in Texas cities?</a></strong></p>, <p>I frequently travel between Houston and my parents\u2019 home in Corpus Christi, and there are several spots along that route where T-Mobile\u2019s service drops to a weak one bar, or I get the dreaded \u201cNo Service\u201d notification. Fortunately, the dropouts don\u2019t last long. Occasional dropouts were also an issue on a trip <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/Road-trip-Taking-our-new-T-Mobile-service-to-San-12894061.php">earlier this year to San Antonio</a>.</p>, <p>I\u2019m particularly happy with upload speeds, which handily beat the paltry 5 Mbps uploads I get with my Comcast broadband connection. Upload speeds are often near or just below download speeds. Often, if I need to upload something large, I\u2019ll use my iPhone rather than a computer connected to Comcast at home to get the job done.</p>, <p>As with other carriers, T-Mobile may slow your speeds on its \u201cunlimited\u201d accounts after you reach a certain threshold \u2014 but that limit is much higher. On AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint, you may be slowed once you pass 22 gigabytes of data. On T-Mobile, the threshold is 50 GB. So far, we\u2019ve come nowhere near that point.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, I\u2019m not as happy with one particular aspect of T-Mobile\u2019s speeds.</p>, <p><strong>MOBILE HOTSPOT: C-</strong></p>, <p>The carrier\u2019s standard T-Mobile One account gives you a mobile hotspot, allowing you to connect other devices via Wi-Fi to share data. But unlike AT&amp;T\u2019s mobile hotspot feature that connects at full LTE speeds, T-Mobile throttles its users back to 3G speeds.</p>, <p>If all you are doing is checking email, sending messages or using another text-based application, this slowness is merely annoying. But if you are looking at websites, sending or receiving photos or video, or trying to stream music, T-Mobile\u2019s hotspot is almost useless, particularly if you have two or fewer bars.</p>, <p><strong>SPEED TEST:\xa0<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/PC-Magazine-testing-ranks-cellular-speeds-across-12985660.php">PCMag testing ranks cellular speeds across Houston</a></strong></p>, <p>There is a way to get full LTE speeds on a hotspot, however, by paying more. T-Mobile lets you upgrade to its One Plus service for an additional $15 a month, with a limit of 20GB of LTE hotspot data. One Plus gets you other benefits, including full HD streaming and faster data speeds when traveling to any of 210 countries. I wish T-Mobile would break out the hotspot boost \u2014 I\u2019d pay another $5 a month to get faster hotspot speeds.</p>, <p><strong>VOICE CALLS: B+</strong></p>, <p>For the most part, voice calls are of good quality, particularly when using Wi-Fi calling, or the enhanced LTE feature known as HD Voice. When those aren\u2019t present, though, T-Mobile\u2019s voice calls sometimes don\u2019t match up to what I experienced with AT&amp;T, but those times are rare.</p>, <p>I do get the occasional dropped call with T-Mobile, but then again, I did with AT&amp;T, too. And you can never be sure whether the issue is on your end or on that of the person you\u2019re talking to.</p>, <p><strong>CUSTOMER SERVICE: A-</strong></p>, <p>I have only had to use T-Mobile\u2019s customer service a few times, but so far it has been very good. Representatives contacted via chat and phone have been knowledgeable and efficient. Any issues I had were addressed quickly and to my satisfaction.</p>, <p>I did, however, have one unpleasant surprise early on. An additional charge for an unwanted international calling plan showed up on my account. I was able to get it removed, but not before it was billed, and then a refund was issued. It didn\u2019t cost me anything in the end other than aggravation.</p>, <p><strong>COMING SOON:\xa0<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/5G-promises-Houstonians-faster-internet-more-12925741.php">5G promises Houstonians faster internet, more choice</a></strong></p>, <p>One other small gripe: T-Mobile\u2019s website and app don\u2019t always allow the same kind of self-service capabilities as AT&amp;T. For example, when I wanted to add my daughter with the $20-a-month service, I had either to call or go to a T-Mobile store \u2014 it couldn\u2019t be added online.</p>, <p><strong>EXTRAS AND PERKS: B</strong></p>, <p>T-Mobile offers a lot of extra incentives, but not all of them are available with the Unlimited 55+ account. For example, regular T-Mobile One customers get a free Netflix account, but that\u2019s not available for 55+ users.</p>, <p>The carrier also has an app called T-Mobile Tuesdays, which has a new set of freebies every week. Many of these don\u2019t interest me \u2014 discounted concert tickets, for example \u2014 while others are intriguing. But, they\u2019re not enough to keep me opening the app every Tuesday to see what\u2019s new. Others, though, may find them worthwhile.</p>, <p><strong>OVERALL GRADE: B+</strong></p>, <p>The final grade is dragged down by T-Mobile\u2019s hotspot issues, but if that\u2019s not a big deal for you, then consider the general score to be an A-. We\u2019re very happy we\u2019ve made the switch, and look forward to seeing how T-Mobile handles the upcoming transition to 5G.</p>, <p>(Read my original story about switching at <a href="https://houstonchronicle.com/tmobileswitch" target="_blank">houstonchronicle.com/tmobileswitch</a>, and a followup at <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/Road-trip-Taking-our-new-T-Mobile-service-to-San-12894061.php" target="_blank">houstonchronicle.com/tmobilesa</a>.)</p>, <p><em> </em></p>, <p><em>dwight.silverman@chron.com</em></p>, <p><em> </em></p>, <p><em>twitter.com/dsilverman</em></p>, <p><em>\n<p>houstonchronicle.com/techburger</p>\n</em></p>, <p>houstonchronicle.com/techburger</p>, <p>Dwight Silverman is the technology editor for the Houston Chronicle.

[<p>Sam has some exciting news for 2019: He\u2019s going to get the heck out of Ohio and relocate to Maui. It\u2019s time for him to leave his old Honda Accord behind and get a nice island car to enjoy the sand and the sun. What should he buy?<br/></p>, <p><em>(Welcome back to <a href="http://jalopnik.com/tag/wcsyb" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'http://jalopnik.com/tag/wcsyb', {metric25:1})" rel="nofollow">What Car Should You Buy</a>? Where we give real people real advice about buying cars. )<br/></em></p>, <p>Here is the scenario -<br/></p>, <p>Hi, so I currently drive a 2002 Honda Accord that is starting to show its age. It is getting rusty and the repair bills have been increasing over the past couple of years. I also just found out I will be moving to Maui for work and I think that means this is the perfect time to replace my old Honda. </p>, <p>I live in Ohio right now and my job will pay to ship my car to Hawaii so I will be shopping around here before moving to the island. My wife drives a Jeep Patriot that will be coming with us so my car can be impractical and fun. Really looking for a change of pace from the generic sedan I\u2019ve been driving for years. As for budget I have up to $20,000.</p>, <p class="ad-label proxima"><small class="proxima">Advertisement</small></p>, <p class="ad-label-bottom"></p>, <p><strong>Budget:</strong> up to $20,000</p>, <p><strong>Daily Driver: </strong>Yes</p>, <p><strong>Location: </strong> Maui (but will buy a car on the mainland)</p>, <p><strong>Wants: </strong>Something fun for the sun, but reliable</p>, <p><strong>Doesn\u2019t want: </strong>A big SUV</p>, <p class="ad-label proxima"><small class="proxima">Advertisement</small></p>, <p class="ad-label-bottom"></p>, <p>Sam, I\u2019ve got to admit I\u2019m a bit jealous, but congrats on the move. You have obviously suffered enough in Ohio and now it\u2019s time for sunny skies and warm beaches.</p>, <p>Obviously, if you are going to get an island car you need something with an open top, but you will want to keep in mind that living in Hawaii is expensive\u2014like ridiculously expensive\u2014so you may not want to blow your whole budget and keep some money aside for a rainy day fund.<br/></p>, <p>Of course, if you want to be a real badass in Hawaii you get a Ferrari 308 like Magnum had, but those probably aren\u2019t the wisest purchase if you want something reliable. But there is the next best thing if you like the idea of a mid-engined convertible: The Toyota MR2.</p>, <p class="ad-label proxima"><small class="proxima">Advertisement</small></p>, <p class="ad-label-bottom"></p>, <p>I wanted to find you a nice MR2 with t-tops from the mid-\u201890s but due to the Radwood Effect those are currently going for bonkers money. While the later MR2 Spyder from the early 2000s may not have the same exotic lines, it is a fantastic little car for blasting around an island.<a href="https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=501160130&amp;zip=45377&amp;referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fsearchresults.xhtml%3Fzip%3D45377%26startYear%3D1981%26sortBy%3DderivedpriceDESC%26incremental%3Dall%26firstRecord%3D25%26marketExtension%3Don%26endYear%3D2019%26modelCodeList%3DMR2%252CMR2SPYDR%26makeCodeList%3DTOYOTA%26searchRadius%3D0&amp;startYear=1981&amp;numRecords=25&amp;firstRecord=25&amp;endYear=2019&amp;modelCodeList=MR2%2CMR2SPYDR&amp;makeCodeList=TOYOTA&amp;searchRadius=0&amp;makeCode1=TOYOTA&amp;modelCode1=MR2SPYDR&amp;clickType=listing" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=501160130&amp;zip=45377&amp;referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fsearchresults.xhtml%3Fzip%3D45377%26startYear%3D1981%26sortBy%3DderivedpriceDESC%26incremental%3Dall%26firstRecord%3D25%26marketExtension%3Don%26endYear%3D2019%26modelCodeList%3DMR2%252CMR2SPYDR%26makeCodeList%3DTOYOTA%26searchRadius%3D0&amp;startYear=1981&amp;numRecords=25&amp;firstRecord=25&amp;endYear=2019&amp;modelCodeList=MR2%2CMR2SPYDR&amp;makeCodeList=TOYOTA&amp;searchRadius=0&amp;makeCode1=TOYOTA&amp;modelCode1=MR2SPYDR&amp;clickType=listing', {metric25:1})" rel="noopener" target="_blank">\xa0</a></p>, <p><a href="https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=501160130&amp;zip=45377&amp;referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fsearchresults.xhtml%3Fzip%3D45377%26startYear%3D1981%26sortBy%3DderivedpriceDESC%26incremental%3Dall%26firstRecord%3D25%26marketExtension%3Don%26endYear%3D2019%26modelCodeList%3DMR2%252CMR2SPYDR%26makeCodeList%3DTOYOTA%26searchRadius%3D0&amp;startYear=1981&amp;numRecords=25&amp;firstRecord=25&amp;endYear=2019&amp;modelCodeList=MR2%2CMR2SPYDR&amp;makeCodeList=TOYOTA&amp;searchRadius=0&amp;makeCode1=TOYOTA&amp;modelCode1=MR2SPYDR&amp;clickType=listing" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=501160130&amp;zip=45377&amp;referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fsearchresults.xhtml%3Fzip%3D45377%26startYear%3D1981%26sortBy%3DderivedpriceDESC%26incremental%3Dall%26firstRecord%3D25%26marketExtension%3Don%26endYear%3D2019%26modelCodeList%3DMR2%252CMR2SPYDR%26makeCodeList%3DTOYOTA%26searchRadius%3D0&amp;startYear=1981&amp;numRecords=25&amp;firstRecord=25&amp;endYear=2019&amp;modelCodeList=MR2%2CMR2SPYDR&amp;makeCodeList=TOYOTA&amp;searchRadius=0&amp;makeCode1=TOYOTA&amp;modelCode1=MR2SPYDR&amp;clickType=listing', {metric25:1})" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here is a 2003 with around 50,000 miles and a manual gearbox for $8,500</a>.
